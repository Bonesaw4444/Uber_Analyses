GF and I went to the game in Washington last night and I was positively delighted to see the Capitals get PWND by the Canadiens. There were more Habs fans in the crowd than I had expected and we were fortunate enough to have a couple across the aisle from Longueuil. Capitol One Arena is neither the Forum nor Centre Bell (the Habs played in the Forum when I lived in Montréal), but it was a great game for us Canadiens fans. It was not so great for GF (who is a Capitals fan) and the other Capitals fans..............Oddly enough, there were only two penalties in the game, one to each team. Washington did score on its power play. The Habs scored right after the Washington penalty expired but before the Washington player could get back into the action.The Habs return to Washington 20 February and GF and I WILL be there!!!!We rode Uber to get there, as it is difficult to get a cab where I live in Washington. We rode a cab back. The cab was less expensive than UBer."

Let's Stop BS'ing I uber in Mtl,,229524,0,
Let's Stop BS'ing I uber in Mtl,givemewine1st,3438938,229524,"three years ago drivers earned double the rate and on the week ends incentives were very generous and surges sometimes 4 times and more.Today uber x drivers make .79 per km minus 25 %To generate 1000 in a paycheck deposit. 1250 dollars must be generatedThat means no less than 160 to 180 ridesAssuming the average ride is $7 before uber cut that is alot of time spent away from home to generate brut income.The idea that uber x drivers make net 12 or more dollars per hour is a flat out lie.Driver partners need to do spreadsheets with all the details and not just with a fewJust to look good.I have been at it for 8 months.I drive a japanese car that does 28 mpg.My cost per km whether i have a client or not is .26So if I drive 1500 kms in one week my cost is $390 gaz included.So if my paycheck is 1000 but my expenses that include future repairs insurance plates cell phone car wash etc is $390 then I earned $610 and that $610 i can not spend because part of it goes to the govDepending on what my total income will be my tax bill could be upwards of 20 % of my 610 and how may hours was I on the road before expenses?And the 390 has to be banked to pay for gaz tires and shock absorbers and everything else that suddenly goes wrong. And they will go wrong.My suspension costs related to Montreal potholes and wear tear was $1800 in 2017 which represents almost 20 percent of 2017 brut revs. .Uber rate per km after its cut is .60So how in God s name can anyone state they make net over 1000?Unless of course they don t calculate surprise costs?Just because some do not factor these costs in does not negate the reality that every part of every car between 1km and 300,000 kms will have to be replaced at least once. Just do the math.Calculate every cost into the future until you change your vehicule divide the total by 300,000 and presto you have your cost rate per km used be it with Uber or personal.In the $610 i do not calculate lunch costs or coffees or the wasted time costs that I incur along with all other drivers who incur it when they wait or when they roam or when they drive to fetch a client. If i had to add that cost to the expense sheet as ""lost income"" it would represent at leat another 400 dollars in lost revs.Nobody talks about the cost of kms incurred going to clients.The lost revenue cost due to going to clients is never talked about yet it is real because we earn nothing fetching the riders unlike plumbers who are paid for their time going to the clients.SoThe next time anyone lies to you that as a uber x driver makes 20 bucks an hour net you have my permission to ring their neck and drop them off the coast of BS Island hook them in with a fish line and feed them salt and vinegar until they stop spewing deceipt.There is nothing dishonorable in being in business to earn even $1 per hour.It is your business your time your right.At the very least we all need to know before we sign up .Not 6 months later after we age our cars by 10000 miles.Make sense. Yes or no.Is it Uber s job to tell you to do the math?No.They are having trouble making profits despite their 25% cut on our revs and higher rates paid by riders.1000 net per week after gaz? Yes. But not after all the other expenses that amount to a staggering .26/.60 and that my dear friends is the truth.Having said this.""go out and earn what you earn but please...do not ever BS again about net revs that you can not prove as a uber x driver. If you can not prove it them you are not being honest with yourself and potential drivers.It is ok to earn 1 dollar per hour as they do in certain parts of the world.It is ok to state that after my expenses I earn net approx $7/ hour.It is ok to state that the rate paid by uber per km is at least 50 % less than whatIt should be to retain full time drivers.It is ok to state that many quit driving due to poor rates per km and other ride sharing companies make the same mistake. Ironically the soldiers that make Uber possible are earning less than required.Give people the truth.It might not be much but hey we all have to start somewhere.Let us state the truth.Lets be honest.If you can prove that you earn what you earn then give us a spreadsheetAnd please do not forget anything.Do the math.Uber did it before they began .And their logirythmic program recalculates 1000 times per second.At the very least do it at least once.From A to Z.Only then you will know.Do not assume the ads are revealing all the facts.They don't."
Let's Stop BS'ing I uber in Mtl,illusion,3439117,229524,"lollll , a lot of uber drivers are suck in math , i met a lot of them and they are deducting just gaz as expense, and the rest are too lazy to get a real job, but who am i to judge"

Let's Stop BS'ing I uber in Mtl,pacifico,3998364,229524,"I agree we need to do the proper calculations, and that actually uber is not good as a full time job,lets see this math:28mpg equals 8.4 lts/100km cost is variable because gas prices so lets say gas is $1.50 a liter (expensive) then : 1500km is 15 times 100km so 15x 8.4 lts × $1.50 is $189 for the 1500km; jeje we save some money herenow each km should be like $0.126 at $1.5/liter gas price, so maybe the car is not so good in gasso just for considering the gas we will do $0.664/km x 1500 equals $996 minus 25% equals $747+10% (tax return) equals $821.7 aprox. paycheckregards"
Let's Stop BS'ing I uber in Mtl,givemewine1st,3999328,0,You calculated fuel but ignored everthing else. Kms you stftef were total kms used to generate pay or was it kms driving the riders? Because it kms stated were kms used drivibg riders you forgot to mention the other kms used to fetch the clients. Mys stats 45%f all kms used are roaming kms and tge other 55%;are the kms we are paid more. Since you stated that you gas cost per km is 12.6 pennies then if 1500 kms used driving riders we also usedca min 600kms more fetching the riders .2100 kms used. So nowbout total fuel cost is 2100kms times .126/kmm= 264.60 still laughing?What about other costs that will show uo? Do you know what the cost will be?I know with my sentra if i drive it.ro the finish line fuel is .07/km and .23/km are all future costs including car replacement.Which means for every km driven i bank .30/km i do not spend it or i will fins myself out in the streets when i cant pay the rent because i fixesld the car.My point.is if as drivers we are paid net .60 /km in montreal but if for a car like a sentra only have of that revenue i can spend then the bottom line is alot worse that what you say your.check is.Because if you factor in all the costBank itWhat you.actually earn is less min wageLets look at your statsYou got oais for 1500 kmsBut you used 2100Min cost for 2100 kms is $630.126/km for fuel.174/km for all future car costTake your paycheckSubtract 630Divide by the hours you were online to drive 2100 kmsMin 50 hours822 paycheckMinus gaz and future costs of 630Net 192 for 50 hoursBut.wait ..It cant be true..What will uber drivers do when they spend.it as fast as they make.it.but.never bank.any money.for.future.repairs?Or to replace car?In 3 years car will bw.finishedThe driver is.bankruptAnd he sleeps.in.his carYou sure you want to recruit a best friend as a uber driver?Best to.recruit.someone.you hate.Because it is a slave creating.company.
Let's Stop BS'ing I uber in Mtl,Icannotlie,5402388,229524,"Ok, I just read this nonsense and your calculations can be applied to any job. Making $75 an hour in an office job requires expenses (car, gas, car depreciation and repairs, parking bus passes, other travel, suits, makeup for women, hair cuts, shoes, lunches, dinners, memberships, etc.) that, when deducted from your pay can leave you with $7/hour. It’s called life. Let’s not exaggerate in the other direction.I’d say that with Uber you have to work smart, not hard. As an independent contractor, I deduct more than a third of what I earn in business expenses (car lease, registration, license, gas, etc.) that saves in taxes alone. I don’t waste a lot of time waiting around. I drive at the peak times only, 11:00 to 2:00 and 5:00 to 9:00 (later on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday).There’s no question that it’s not a dream job, but you don’t have to be so discouraging.

How is driving this year?,Another Uber Driver,6520719,413059,"It varies by market. In my market, generally, you can stay busy. The promotions have not been very good, of late, except late at night. The surges come and go, both in the day and at night.Some have mentioned that food delivery has fallen off, of late.Some of the ants who stopped working have come back since the Government ""Cheese"" in the E.E.U.U. has stopped and our Congress can not seem to come up with anything new. Not all of them have returned, however. In addition, there has been some customer loss since the customers are not getting Government ""Cheese"", either.I do not know what the Federal or Provincial Government is doing for you, up there, but, it could have an impact on business. We do have fewer people out of work in the Capital of the E.E.U.U., so we are not hurting as badly as other parts of the country.Bienvenu à UPpointNet"

What’s wrong with uber eats,Another Uber Driver,6376595,6376009,"Some Cheatsdrivers South of Your Border have made similar complaints. They sit somewhere that has many restaurants and watch drivers' going in and out. In the Capital of the U.S. of A., we have several delivery applications, so the drivers here can not always be sure who it is. In other places, FubarCheatsis the only one, so they know. There has been more than one complaint that the application is showing favouritism to certain drivers; often rookies.Some drivers have complained about this when they reject jobs. They have reported that they declined two or three jobs then did not get anything for thirty or so minutes. It could be that Uber is putting drivers on ""tme out"" without informing them.This also happens to UberX drivers. UberX drivers can, however, turn on the passenger application and make sure that it ""sees"" their car. Some times, it does not, so they must sign out and sign in once more.

What’s wrong with uber eats,bigfrog,6378062,6378053,"No, these are two things. The first is that only one order is generated at 5-6 o'clock for two consecutive days. The second thing is to say that because of the slow traffic, 4 orders can be completed in an hour before, and now it has dropped to 2-3 orders."
What’s wrong with uber eats,Another Uber Driver,6378083,406025,"The whole thing has slowed, then.It might be that due to the lifting of restrictions in Montréal, either people are going out to eat or that they are just picking up the stuff themselves. People have been cooped up for so long that they are using anything as an excuse to get out. I never made a habit of delivering food, so I am not sure of the peak times.Perhaps consider driving UberX? I know that you must get a special licence for it in Québec, but, if the restrictions are being lifted, the government offices should open. I would guess that there would be a mad rush the first couple of weeks, but, after that, it should calm down. Perhaps the last time that I had to deal with any government office in Québec was when I was a young man and it was something with my truck driver's licence.................either that or Immigration, although that is a Federal thing."

french,Another Uber Driver,5216598,5216326,"The first three, of course, are routine questions that you ask passengers several times daily. The last five are to deal with the nonsense that passengers often try to pull: telling you to break traffic laws because they are late; they want to eat in the car and leave the mess for you to clean up, they want to drink beer in the car and they have these messy animals and try to pass them off as ""service animals"" in an attempt to hustle you into taking them.If it is a smaller animal, it must be in a container. I am not letting a cat claw my seats. I had one try to get in with a parakeet. This bird must have been well trained, because it stayed on her shoulder and did not fly away, but, I was not allowing it in my car so that it could poo everywhere. I have heard from drivers who told me about ""service snakes"", ""service frogs"" or ""service raccoons"".

french,Mash Ghasem,6038105,5215603,"It's been 4 decades, but, say what? Local slang/accent?"
french,Another Uber Driver,6038233,6038105,"dretteis an archaic version ofdroit.icitteis an archaic version ofici.charis a disguised Anglicism forvoitureorauto. In Canada or Louisiana, if you want to drive avoiture, you need horses, literally (I suppose that donkeys might do in a pinch).. Many things that appeared after the French left Canada and Louisiana are Gallicised versions of the English word. In addition, you see many literal translations of English expressions into French in both Canada and Louisiana; hencedrette icittefor :""right here"". No one in France, Switzerland, Belgium or Francophone Africa says ""droit ici"". In Canada and Louisiana, however, they do saydrette icitte.The Québec and Cajun dialects are essentially seventeenth century French. Take care not to confuse Cajun French with Kouri-Vini. Cajun French is French. Kouri-Vini is not; it is the dialect of Creole commonly spoken in Louisiana.I learned to speak French from a Cajun nanny when I was a child. This explains why I tend to write in dialect rather thanfrançais métropolitain. The Cajun and Québec dialects are similar enough that I had little trouble during the three years that I lived in Montréal. When I lived there, I lived insud-ouestwhich was a slum, at the time. English was useless, there, at the time.Of course, my nanny did not teach me any swear words. I learned a few in /high school because there was one kid from Montréal and one from Liège in my class, so they taught me a few Québec and Belgian swear words. When I lived in Montréal, I learned even more. Thus, while I speak Cajun French, I usequébecoisswear words. This results in combinations such ascouillon tabarnak, which you will not hear often in Montréal.Couillonis an almost universal term of abuse in the Cajun dialect. It is the equivalent of ""dumbass"" in English. In Québec,tabarnak(ortabernak--in Québec and Louisiana, the French ""e"" is often pronounced as a French ""a"") is the equivalent of an English word that is banned on this forum.Calicéis the equivalent of the past participle of a modern vulgar English verb derived from a vulgar verb of Anglo-Saxon origin, that is also banned on this forum."
french,Etienne_,6038348,6038105,"We have still people saying these words but it is considered here in Montreal as old Quebec french or Acadians french.But we do still use char, a drette, and icitte. We have many ""sacres"" vocabulairy too like tabarnac, osti, calice, saint-ciboire, sacrements etc.I think that now slangs are more in the prononciation. Likebonne Soirée -> bonne souéréeBut still I don't have a clue of the slang I use &#128514;.I think it is better talking to client in a ""correct french"".I do call my clients ""chef"" sometimes. In English it is like saying boss. Like in:C'est où qu'on va, chef?Meaning:where are we heading, boss?"
french,Another Uber Driver,6038503,6038348,"It has been a long time since I lived there, but, at that time, they still used the old dialect. As I understand it, that old dialect is changing. The Louisiana Cajun is descended from the Acadian (modern Nova Scotia) dialect. In that dialect, the ""d"" before ""i"" (or sometimes ""e"") is often pronounced as the English ""j"", henceah-kah-dju'>kah-ju'.In Québec, the ""d"" before ""i"" (or sometimes even ""e"") is often pronounced as the English ""dz"" Thus, where you hear the ""dz"" in Québec City or Montréal, you will hear ""j"" in LaFayette, Thibodeaux or Kenner.In Louisiana, the State created CODIFIL with the intention of preserving the Cajun dialect. There was a long time director who thought that the best way to do that was to teach onlyfrançais métropolitainin the immersion programmes and not expose anyone to the Cajun dialect until the university level. That director did step aside. Now they offer exposure to the Cajun dialect in most immersion programmes in the high schools, some in the middle schools and even one or two elementary schools. What they do in those immersion schools is teach some subjects in English, some infrançais métropolitainand some in Cajun French. If you listen to the young people in those immersion programmes, you can tell that they studiedfrançais métropolitain. They will use the oblique case pronouns as nominatives, they will not use the ""ne....pas"" double negatives, rather ""pas"" alone. They will go even as far as to use ""pas jamais"" for ""ne......jamais"". They will use the archaic forms such asvous-autres, icitteanddrette. They even trill their ""r"". Still, you can tell. That really is not a big deal. The dialect will be preserved. Language is dynamic, anyhow. This is why you are sayingJe vois l'ours que courtinstead ofUrsum quod currit video(common Latin) orUrsum currentem video/Video ursum qui currit.(classical Latin)............and we now say:Hail Mary, full of Grace, the Lord is with you.Blessed are you among women andBlessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus (the Anglo-Saxon word is ""the Lord"")Holy Mary, mother of GodPray for us sinners;Now and at the hour of our death. Ameninstead of:Nal Wes ðu,Maria, mid gyfe gefylled, Drihten midðe.Đu eart gebletsoð on wifum andgebletsod ðines innoðes wæstm, se Næland.Nalige Maria, Godes modorgebide for us synfullum,nu and on pære tide ures forðsiðes.

I repeat back "" œs-tchee duh cœlo'. He puts his hands to his head in frustration. In Cajun dialect, where the Quebecker would pronounce ""ts"", the Cajun pronounces ""tch"" or ""ch"".'tite blonde, pronounced ""cheet blœnde"" is a ""cute girl"". As in Canada,la blondeis usually your girlfirend in Louisiana, but, at times it can mean simply a ""girl""or ""young woman""............not to be confused withpichouanque, which is your ""little girl"" or ""daughter"", although it often means ""brat"".

They understood me far easier than those in Europe did.Jemedois arreter.Placing the object pronoun before the main verb as opposed to the infinitive of which it is the object is an archaic construction. Compare ItalianMi debbo fermare.""Mi"" is the object of ""debbo"", but, Italian grammar demands that it be put before the main verb, rather than the infinitive of which it is the object. Actually, Italian prefersDebbo fermarmi, that is attaching the pronoun to the end of the infinitive of which it is the object, but the first example is acceptable.Spanish:Debo pararme. That is currently the only correct version in Spanish. Up until the very early twentieth century,Me debo pararwas acceptable, but only in Spain. It was not considered acceptable in the Americas.voudrois-that is an archaic conditional. In some parishes in Louisiana, they use the archaic forms of the conditional, imperfect and pluperfect tenses. In some parishes they will both write and pronounce the archaic forms. In some parishes, they will write the archaic forms but pronounce them as if they were the current forms. In other parishes, they both write and speak the current forms. Consider that infrançais métropolitain, the archaic forms of those tenses were written well into the nineteenth century, although they had not been pronounced that way in many places for years.minou-Cajun French for a house cat. It is also what a Cajun house cat says. Thus, ""bouge ce minou là de la table drette asteure!"" translates literally as ""Get that meow off the table right now!"" (for some reason, Cajun house cats like to sit on tables). In many parishes,le chathas huge claws, large teeth and weighs anywhere from seventy to one hundred kilos.chaoui=raton laveur. It is likely thatraton laveurwas invented in Canada as the raccoon is an American animal; literally ""the washing rat"" Compare ItalianOrsino lavatore; ""the little bear that washes"".Chaouiis the Choctaw word for him. Use of American Indian words is not uncommon in both Québec and Cajun French. If you ask a bar tender in Montréal or LaFayette for ""vodka-atoca"" he will know what you want. Do not try that in Lyon or Neuchatel. In Spanish, his name ismapache, which is the Aztec word for him."

Quebec's transport and health ministers react.12NextSHARE1KMONTREAL -- About 200 vehicles were involved in a massive road accident Wednesday on a windswept stretch of Highway 15, on Montreal's South Shore, that killed two people, injured dozens and prompted a major emergency intervention.The cars began colliding soon after noon in La Prairie. Strong winds had blown snow off the St. Lawrence River, obscuring drivers' views, some of them said. Though the weather was clear and the highway had recently been cleared of snow, according to Quebec Transport Minister Francois Bonnardel, gusts of wind can cause whiteout conditions in the area.A group of American tourists witnessed the start of the wreckage. Whiteout conditions obscured their vision as they merged onto the highway, Spencer Jacob, a tourist from upstate New York, told CTV News. The group pulled over and called the police. Sometime later, with visibility still low, an ambulance arrived, parked in front of their car and was struck by another car, Jacob said. The collision blocked the highway and sparked the pileup.Related Stories'We had to run up the road': Witnesses tell how pileup started on Montreal's South Shore""That's when we were like 'this is bad,' and we need to get out of the car. Our doors were pressed against the snow so we had to get out of the windows and run up onto the snowbank and we were just watching,"" Jacob said. The tourists tried to warn oncoming cars, but the whiteout persisted.The chaos extended along a kilometre stretch of the highway.Firefighters used hydraulic cutters to extricate people from at least nine vehicles. First responders had been trying all afternoon to extract two seriously injured people from a vehicle, but they died, the SQ said Wednesday evening. A tanker truck containing oil had ruptured, spilling diesel onto the road, hindering emergency crews' efforts to access the two people.Ambulances rushed dozens of people away from the scene, prompting three local hospitals to declare a ""code orange"" as they received patients.Shuttle buses transported about 150 people away from the accident to a nearby community centre where health officials continued to evaluate them, sending some to the hospital.Of the 200 vehicles involved, 50 were able to drive away on their own, a spokesperson for the Quebec provincial police, the Surete du Quebec (SQ), said. Another 75 will have to be towed, the spokesperson added. A dozen large trucks and a school bus, whose passengers were uninjured, were also among the vehicles involved.Cars were travelling at about 100 km/h at the time of the crash, one witness told local radio station CJAD 800. ""As I was driving along going about 90 to 100, all I saw was red lights, brake lights, cars just hitting each other, trying to swerve out of the way,"" said the witness, who gave his name as Kyle and said he was uninjured. ""I tried to do the same myself, and I got hit by another bus, smacked into the retaining wall.""Many of the cars are destroyed.The windswept portion of the highway where the pileup occurred is vulnerable to southwesterly winds coming off the St. Lawrence River. It's an exposed patch of road where wind can toss snow into the air, obscuring visibility. Investigators will try to confirm the cause of the crash, but Bonnardel, the transport minister, suspected windy, whiteout conditions were to blame.The accident forced the closure of Highway 15 in both directions between Matte and Montcalm Boulevards. It will remain closed for an ""undetermined"" amount of time, according to Transports Quebec. Bonnardel said it could be closed until Thursday morning. The northbound lanes had reopened as of midnight Wednesday but the southbound lanes were still closed.Premier Francois Legault tweeted about the incident, saying his thoughts were with those affected.The SQ urged people to avoid the area. Alternate routes should be sought, the police force warned.Wednesday's pileup was the second major road accident on the South Shore inside of two days. On Tuesday, more than a dozen cars smashed into each other, leaving some with minor injuries after wind likely caused whiteout conditions along a stretch of Highway 10, in Marieville.RELATED IMAGES"

US resident able to work in MTL?,Another Uber Driver,5039101,330152,"The only reason that I was able to work in Canada is that when I lived up there, they had a hard time finding English/French bi-lingual truck drivers. At the time, I spoke mostly Cajun French with a little Belgian thrown into it, but, that did not matter; I could communicate in French and English, so they were allowed to hire me.This occurred many years past. There was no such thing as any kind of wireless telephone at the time. Canada has become only more strict since then. While I understand that Uber drivers are independent contractors and all that, Canada does not look at them in quite the same way as does the U.S. of A.You do have to get a special licence in Montréal. Part of the licencing requirement is that you must demonstrate some proficiency in French.There is an office to which you must go in Montréal to get your licence."

Using my company for uber,,321801,0,
Using my company for uber,Snikok,4913539,321801,Is it possible to use my company’s GST/QST numbers as well as receive pay on my company’s account so in the end of the year i can write off 50c per km? Did anybody try this? My accountant said it’s doable and u can write off much more this way than just ur gas and other expenses.
Using my company for uber,Babaganush,4952533,321801,"I was told at first it was possible, then when I tried to change my account from my name to my company they told me no. I tried 3 times and all said it is not possible.Now keep in mind that all Uber related expenses from car payments, repairs, car insurance, gas and anything else incurred for Uber are deductible from your Uber income. You need to have your start and end odometer reading, the percentage used for Uber is the deduction percentage.Because Uber uses the simple method for GST/QST in Quebec, you just need to worry about the total amount paid as you won't be able to claim the GST/QST back like you would in a regular business.If you are able to do it, they may have changed the rules, please let us know in this post."
Using my company for uber,Snikok,4959002,321801,"Thanks for ur replyMy friend just put his company’s name and gst/qst number when he was registering. Nobody checked and now he gets paid through his company. However, when i asked them to change my numbers and stuff they said its not possible cuz of Quebec rules. So i don’t understand how come someone can do it and others can’t. Also my accountant said that many drivers use their companies. This way u can write off much more, especially if u do many hours.Btw should i just take a picture of my odometer in the beginning of the year? How will they know how many km’s i did driving uber?"
Using my company for uber,Babaganush,4959015,321801,"My beginning odometer was what was registered the car inspection, for the end of the year I took a picture and emailed it to myself.I was told I could use my company when I registered as well, but I had just registered it and did not have the GST/QST number yet."

How big my trunk should be?,Another Uber Driver,4753486,311446,"Both of mine are hybrids. Time was the Uber encouraged the use of hybrids. The original concept of UberX was a fleet of hybrids; ""Do your part for the planet, ride UberX"". For many years in the early markets, such as San Francisco, when you ordered UberX, you got a Prius. The Prius does have more trunk space than the Fusion, but, it also has less passenger room.We have users here who will reject a Prius or give it an automatic one-star.Sauf si les règles à Montréal l'interdisiont, la Fusion devroit-être satisfaisante. Chez Uber, la Fusion devroit-être OK."

(I'm not judging, we're much too fat up here in Canada too!)I have always thought the rise of SUV/CUV and Trucks was that over the past 30 years, the average citizen is pushing further and further towards obesity.I'd expect this less in NYC, San Francisco or Portland, which are heavy walking cities.I have a number of people look disapprovingly at the back seat of my 2017 Chevy Volt and attempt to squeeze in. Anyone with a 'healthy weight' would not have an issue in a PRIUS, they are pretty large on the inside. It's the morbidly obese, buy two seats on the airplane, set that might have some issues.

Bureau de Taxi,pacifico,4672610,304863,"uber will not inmediately disable your account but when your document needs to be updated, they will suspend your account. But if your license was suspended means if you drive you are already breaking the law, don't do that if something happens on the road with a suspended license could be actually bad for you"

Is anyone making money with UberEats?,Calendyr,3017340,202119,"Hello guys, I am new to the forum.So while waiting for my 4c driver class, I decided to apply to do delivery for UberEats.I worked 2.5 hours yesterday and was shocked on how bad this is for drivers.So I went online at 16:00, expecting orders to start coming in at around 16:30.So I was online between 16:00 and 18:30 and got a total of 2 orders. I made 8.84$ before expenses for 2.5 hours of work.First problem is that I got pinged 10 mins away both times, so a lot of driving to pickup the orders. Then on the second order I had to wait 15 mins at the restaurant because the order was not ready. Then nothing for about 45 mins so I went offline.Is this a typical experience for you guys, if not do you have any tips on how to make a reasonable income with UberEats?"
Is anyone making money with UberEats?,Tbc007,3019101,202119,"Pretty much. UberEATS can be worse than standard Uber. There's not enough demand and too many drivers. Customers don't tip because they already pay fee for delivery. The pay sucks because you're not paid to wait at the restaurant (food often not ready) and there's the hassle of finding parking. Also, even if you get a decent paying run, it could send you to an area with ZERO restaurants, forcing you to drive dead KMs back.Best advice for UberEATS is not to bother. However if you're still game for it I would suggest to look at it as revenue per KM driven instead of as an hourly rate. Try to minimize KMs driven the best you can to and from a restaurant. Also, time of year, weather, time of day/night, events etc will all have an impact on how busy or quiet it can get."

I did not have any problem with French as I had a Belgian mathematics teacher when I was in high school and an Acadienne nanny when I was a child. As one poster that I quoted put it, he would not live anywhere in Québec unless he learned to speak French. I found it more useful than English when I lived in Montréal."

New Jersey Driver taking a road trip to Montreal.,Lepke,2844907,190930,I will be driving up to Montreal with the family in a couple of weeks and was wondering if you Montrealers had any advice or recommendations on places to see and places to eat.Best ways to get around or any other advice.Thanks in advance.
New Jersey Driver taking a road trip to Montreal.,mtl514,2845006,190930,"Take public transportation. Construction will be back in full force on Monday from holidays and everything will close in around downtown. Metro/Train/Bus is your best bet.Check out the old port and surrounding area, lots of restaurants and festivities happening. Foodwise, it's all depending on what you prefer. Definitely try poutine."
New Jersey Driver taking a road trip to Montreal.,Lepke,2845121,2845006,"Smoked meat, Bagels and poutine are definitely on the list.As is the Botanic Garden and the biodome.We are thinking of staying close to downtown at the Hilton Garden centre-ville.Do you think that would be a good place to stay or should we look for something a little further out that is a little bit cheaper?And thanks for your advice about the traffic.I would imagine that they need to get the road work done while the weather is nice."
New Jersey Driver taking a road trip to Montreal.,mtl514,2848217,2845121,"That is a perfect spot to stay if you want access to everything walking distance and close to metro stations. Bonaventure hotel is even closer walking distance to old port and steps away from central station. If you feel the heat, you can always go underground, check out the underground cityhttp://montrealundergroundcity.com-parking will not be included in downtown hotels, maybe exceptions but if you go further out, you may find free parking with hotel. Highways during weekdays are not so crowded so don't worry about travel distance, it's a relatively small city. Rush hours are from 7-10am and 3-7pm, earlier on fridays.If you like ice cream, check out Kem Coba, little lineup but worth it."
New Jersey Driver taking a road trip to Montreal.,Lepke,2848450,2848217,"Wow great advice.Definitely going to have to check out Kem Coba because my 14 year old will get a huge kick out of trying Montreal ice cream.I used to have a girlfriend in NDG but that was more than 30 years ago and I haven't been to Montreal since.We're probably going to stay downtown even if we have to pay for parking at the hotel because having to travel from the outskirts will take money and time and I'm sure finding parking is not always easy. I think it will be nice to have everything at our fingertips.And hell, we are going to be on vacation so I might as well Splurge a little bit to get the Rooftop indoor swimming pool with the view of the city.We might take a day trip to Quebec City as I have never been there and I think it would be nice to see.If you have any suggestions for places to eat or things to see that are less touristy and frequented by locals it would be appreciated.Everyone says that Schwartz's is the place to go for smoked meat but I have found in my travels that the big-name place is Never As Good As it used to be and a lot of locals have their own favorites.For example in Philadelphia Pat's and Geno's are the two famous cheesesteak places but the locals say that they are for the tourists and they have their own favorites.Of course I will have to wait on line for Schwartz's because it is one of those Montreal places that you have to make a pilgrimage to.Where is your favorite poutine?I really appreciate your feedback. It's always great to learn things from people who know their cities."

New Jersey Driver taking a road trip to Montreal.,Lepke,2859303,0,Well here in New Jersey we have something they called Disco Fries.It's french fries with gravy and cheese and people here think they invented it.There ain't nothing wrong with french fries and gravy especially 3 in the morning when you are stumbling out of a nightclub.

Do all Montreal Drivers call and ask destination after accepting trips?,MUGATS,2152356,144279,"I was visiting this past week on business and had 3 out of 4 drivers accept my ping and then call to find my destination.I'm a driver myself and I know this is a big no-no. How do they avoid getting deactivated if this is a regular practice? One complained it was too far for pickup.... I asked why he accepted the ping... No answer.I'd never report anyone, but it was annoying... I could understand if a pax decided to. I had to take a taxi twice because of it.I was on the south shore.Anyways, whoever it was missed out on two shorter rides ($7-8 rides) but they would have both been tipped decently."
Do all Montreal Drivers call and ask destination after accepting trips?,Another Uber Driver,2163472,2152356,"Uber Taxi is available in Montréal. It used to be available in Toronto, but I do not know if it is, still (it is not in Hamilton).This is supposed to be against Uber Policy, but drivers do it everywhere, not just in Montréal. Here drivers complain about it because they cover the trip and feel that they got stuck with a trip that they did not want or had to chase a trip that should have been covered by a closer driver which caused them to miss out on a closer trip themselves.They get de-activated only if enough people complain and press the matter. I have heard more than one user complain that he submitted a complaint, received a canned non-response, re-submitted the complaint several times and received more canned non-responses that offered coupons for five dollars off the next Uber Pool ride but no resolution to the complaint. Look familiar? If you wanted something done, you would have to press the complaint. Most users do not want to invest the time when all that they will receive is five dollars off the next U-Pool ride (which they do not use, anyhow). The driver's de-activation would do nothing for them.You used to get similar here in the cab business: drivers used to refuse openly to transport passengers. Usually, the prospective passenger did not bother to complain. If he did, most of the time, nothing happened. The Hack Office usually was so backlogged with complaints that it would press only those from prominent organisations or people. Even then, if the driver or an Official in his Company knew somebody or knew somebody who knew somebody, he could have the complaint quashed. It took a number of changes in practice to get this reversed. Still, if you know somebody or know somebody who knows somebody, you can have the complaint quashed."

Montreal Uber Safety Inspection,Mtluber,2203098,145618,why not canadian tire?
Montreal Uber Safety Inspection,AdamS.UBER17,2206673,2172310,"You can get the safety inspection completed anywhere; not just Canadian Tire. As long as you're getting the safety certification from a certified mechanic and it's the official document, you're good to go.

Go to a trusted certified mechanic or reputable brand for cost saving."
Montreal Uber Safety Inspection,Mtluber,2339294,2339089,"Thank you Adam for your response.Canadian tire garage inspection is needed for uber (in Quebec uber also accepts mr muffler inspection which costs 45$+tx) I have decided to buy a used car from a dealer, is this a good idea to take the car to one of these two garages for inspection ? I mean do they completely check everything so that I can buy the car with peace of mind or I need a second inspection somewhere else?"
Montreal Uber Safety Inspection,AdamS.UBER17,2341008,0,"If I was purchasing the used car from the dealer, I'd have them perform the safety and emissions with the sale. I thought you're initial question was in relation to a car you had already owned and wanted to safety at Toyota. I'm not sure why Canadian tire or Mr. Muffler are the only two franchises you can get your safety done in Quebec. As far as i know its the same safety paper everywhere, so it shouldn't matter. Once again, I stress, if you're just now purchasing your car from the Toyota dealer, used or new, make sure they sell it to you with safety.If you do decide to take it to either Can Tire or Muff, make sure to check the reviews of the ones surrounding your locality. Most Can tires/muff are franchises with different owners so some might operate better than others. Based on the reviews, you will have an idea how well they would inspect your car and whether they will be honest in whats required to pass safety."

As you likely know, in the U.S. of A., we have many immigrants from the Spanish speaking countries. Many of the Catholic churches here offer free English classes to any immigrants, whether they are speak Spanish or something else. In fact, you do not have to be an immigrant. I was aware of a lady who was taking classes at one church who had moved here from Puerto Rico, so she was a citizen, but could not speak English.There are plenty of Catholic churches in French Canada. Do any of them offer classes in French?Is the test in française métropolitaine or française québecoise? If it is française métropolitaine, there are many courses that you can take on-line.From time-to-time, the Canada embassy here will offer classes in Québec French. Before I lived in Montréal, I had a high school mathematics teacher from Belgium who used to tutor me mathematics in French, so I had a working knowledge of the language when I went up there. When I lived in Montréal, I lived in Sud-Ouest. At the time, English was just about useless there. I learned to understand Québec French very quickly. It was not that difficult. I did have another advantage in that I could understand Louisiana French, as well as Belgian. I never could speak Louisiana French too well, but I can understand it."

To be sure, rarely did I speak English when I lived in Montréal, but almost everyone that I knew could speak enough English to get by, if they absolutely had to do so.It can be difficult if you can not communicate with your customer, as you do want to make sure that you are taking them where they want to go. Here, we have many immigrants from Central America. More than a few of them can not speak any English. Often, they will get into the cab and ask outright ¿Habla español?"" I do, although it is Salamanca Spanish with a very heavy Italian accent. If I see that they are having a hard time and can tell that they are Spanish speaking, I will ask ¿Donde quereïs ir?. That makes them relax a bit. In fact, we do not have many Spanish speaking cab drivers here, so I have had a number of the Spanish speaking customers ask for my card.What is funny is:1. The U.S. of A. is the second largest Spanish speaking country in the world. We passed Spain a few years back. Mexico, is, of course, the largest and always will be, but the U.S. of A. is number two. This is an English speaking country.2. Despite the requirement to learn English for citizenship, there is no official language in the U.S. of A.3. Until 1979, the second most spoken language in the U.S. of A. wasItalian. I would have thought French or Spanish, but no, it was Italian. To be sure, the statisticians were calling Standard Italian as well as all of the dialects (Siciliano, Calabrese, Pugliese, Sardo, Piemontese......... ) ""Italian"". If you considered each dialect separately, I would suspect that French or Spanish would have been number one. The dialects on the Italian Peninsula (and on Sardegna and Corsica) vary quite a bit more from each other than say Québec French and Cajun French vary from Français Métropolitain.I do not like Icky-D's too much, but GF does, so sometimes I will get her something there and get something for myself somewhere else. There was this one Icky-D's here where they had put a young woman on the counter who could barely speak English. I was on line waiting my turn and I could see that she was having a hard time with the customers. Finally, it was my turn. As I stepped up, I noticed that she had a little pin with a Tunisian flag. So I thought ""let me try this"".""Bon soir. S'il vous plaît, rendez moé deux hambourgers sans ciboules et un lait battu chocolat"".Her eyes lit up and she smiled broadly. She squinted and paused for minute on ""lait battu"", but figured out what it was. GF was on an Icky-D's tear for a while, so I was there frequently. That young lady was so happy to see me every time that I went in there."

I run with a 2013 ford explorer, thus I am also an XL.I AM NOT AN ADMIN at these forums, but since noone since to be picking up the lead, I've decided to take the initiative to put together multiple posts in order to advocate for we, the drivers.Over the next couple weeks, I will invite all of you to respond to subsequent posts with the hopes of improving our driving experience. Some UBER drivers might feel like they have to ""hide their favorite fishing spots"", but having been in most of the various sweet spots around town, I have yet to encounter many problems where there were too many drivers.In any case, I look forward to working with all of you so we can maximize our time as drivers (and make more $$$), and maybe even get organized to pressure UBER Montreal to modify certain quirks of their business model so UBER X/XL/DLX can make a living.Regards,FordXL guy"

I came across your post while browsing uber in other Canadian cities to understand other drives perspectives and experiences. I drive in Toronto and generate an hourly revenue between $22-$30/HR consistently and hit highs of $40+/hr sporadically (all figures before expenses) while maintaining a rating above 4.8 wholistically. I use to avaerge $10-$16/HR when I started off and went through weeks of trials to form a well-informed, educated, systematic approach to maximizing my revenue and profits.I use to browse the forums in Toronto on UberPeople.Net and found many drivers old and new struggling to barely make $11-$18 an hour. Feeling sorry for my fellow Uber drivers, I began posting detailed explanations of my research and suggesting exact routes and methods the past month. I found my uber revenue decreasing, albeit not significantly, over the next two weeks. Some older drivers recommended I take down the posts as it was taking away from our business. I eventually deleted all my posts.That said, if you or fellow Montreal uber drivers are sharing advice, I'd recommend it be with a layman approach without sharing exact times, locations, and hotspots that might take away from each other's revenue.Whether we are uber drivers supplementing our income and practicing law on the side or driving full time, at the end of the day, we must look at our best interests. If those interests lie with philanthropic work that inclues sharing of information that makes other Uber drivers happy by in-directly distributing revenue, then by all means do so."

You got me. $10 an hour minus gas and expenses for me, $25 an hour for you minus gas and expenses for you. Everyone in the The T dot agree?Still calling BS that you have special knowledge and insider knowledge and for the low price $99 you have secrets the rest of us don't know. Until you post your weekly take home I am calling BS. If other drivers are making $11 to $18 and hour and you started at $10 to $16 and found some magic formula I still don't believe you. I made $47 today in one hour after make $4 in 4 hours prior. If you average 8 hours a day and $1000 a week then that's what others will average too. You will not gross 250 percent more then the next Uber Bozo, over time it averages out. Yes, $30 to $40 or $20 plus happens consistently during power hours but show me the proof! I think you are making money selling Uber eBay secrets and anyone who buys this kind of stuff is getting taken."

Fairly New Driver - Intro -Let's get organized,AdamS.UBER17,2213466,0,"Note: All figures before expensesI'm not throwing ridiculous figures at you for my AVERAGE earnings. There are many drivers who make $22-$30/hr consistently. Anything higher would most likely be an isolated event where those earnings are certainly not the norm. I'm claiming pay which is about $25 on AVERAGE and a range from $22-$30.No, I don't sell a course on how to make money with uber or increase income. All it takes is a few weeks of trials to use rational and logical thinking to draw patterns of the city you're located in. This should enable you to drive at optimal times and optimal locations which yield respectable earnings whollistically. I don't drive much now but when I do it's usually early mornings for 4-5 hour shifts (5am-10am). I've consistently made above $20/hr in the past 2 months because of driving patterns I've learned to follow.As far as substantiating my claims, if I posted snaps of my earnings, would you even believe me. You could just as easily discredit the tips I say I made and go as far as saying I photoshopped my screenshots. I understand you're situation and what it really seems to me is your frustrated at the market in Niagara. There's a big snow storm headed your way; that should hopefully increase the demand."

Switch to Pizza Hut,Vavvav,2209303,148127,"4.54 rating, doesn't make a lick of difference. You can have a brutal acceptance rate and brutal cancellation rate and low rating and you will still be on the road with thousands of drivers making less then minimum wage. There is an oversaturated market and too many drivers, you have to struggle to make a dime. I have consistently driven 40 hours per week in Niagara for the last 3 months and average $375 per week. Take away 20 percent for gas and that's $300 a week not including depreciation, taxes, and insurance on the car and that works out to $7.50 an hour, less hen minimum wage. Basically you run your car into the ground and collect the value of the car as you go along and at the front end because at the back end your car is worthless. Throw in oil changes and new tires and worn out brake pads and you are driving for a negative sum. I hear crickets because all the other drivers I know can relate, there is no money to be made driving Uber. Pizza Hut is promising $3.70 per delivery and said I could do 30 to 60 deliveries in a night, plus tips, over 6 to 8 hours. Talked to a 2 for 1 driver and he said they have Hotel Contracts and he and another driver complete 50 deliveries in an 8 to 9 shift on a weekend, 25 during the week, similar deal to Pizza Hut. He said tips are $3 to $4 per delivery. 50 deliveries at say $5 per trip including tip is $250 a night, that's better then Uber boys with less gas, am I missing something? Why are we driving for Uber? If it's $6 after tips that's $300 over 8 hours or over $30 an hour. There has to be a catch with Food Delivery."

What level of French is required to drive Uber in Montreal?,Another Uber Driver,2163554,143346,"I am asking this out of curiosity.Do they make you speak français métropolitain or will they take anything French? Much like Montréal French, in Louisiana you can take certain English words, spell them the way a Francophone would spell them and use them interchangeably with French words. The verbs even conjugate. In Louisiana, you can useconduire, chaufferanddriverinterchangeably (chaufferless frequently than the other two). You will hear ""Je conduisais vignt-cinq minutes pour rendre le téléphone perdu au client"",""Je chauffais vingt-cinq minutes pour rendre le téléphone perdu au client"" or ""Je drivais vingt-cinq minutes pour rendre le téléphone perdu au client"". You might even hear ""Je drivais vingt-cinq minutes pour rendre le téléphone perdua leclient"", but not as frequently as the first and third.In Belgium and Switzerland they sayseptant-cinqinstead ofsoixante quinze. (....although there is a beer brewed in Strasbourg called""Septante-Cinq"")Here, there used to be an oral part to the hack licence test to determine English competency. Here, they would accept ""Raise the hood to check to make sure there is sufficient washer fluid"" or ""Raise thebonnetto make sure that there is sufficient washer fluid"". They would accept ""I will do everything to avoid making passengers angry"" or ""I will do everything to avoid making passengerscross"" In those examples, the former is American usage, the latter British.

All the clients are still trying to sit in the front, which is fine, but I've reassured them that they can sit in the back now if their more comfortable.I'm also glad that the insurance has been resolved with (if I remember correctly) Intact Insurance.How are all of you reacting to the post pilot project?MTLBiceps"
The NEW UBER experience - post pilot project,MTLBiceps,1682686,116359,"Just wanted to give an update on my above post - mostly to people who don't think you can make money. Of course today is Sunday, which is usually a good day to be on the road.Began at 9am this morning (Sunday) and ended roughly 3:30pm. Just a couple of small breaks to grab a coffee at Tim's. About 6.5 hours in total.13 trips roughly $200.00Standard Vieux Port / Downtown / Westmount / plateau trips with some goodies. $18 from downtown to Kahnawake, $50 lachine to Montreal North and end in downtown / $18 downtown to airport. Only one airport which is quite rare for Sunday.Gas cost about $25 - driving a '12 Mercedes C250 v6. Only 2 of the rides were Uber Select but under $10.My standard goal is always to make about $100/4 hours after gas expense. $25 an hour isn't much but I often make closer to $35 / $40 an hour on a good day (Thur, Fri, Sat or Sun typically).And yes the above doesn't take into account any taxes or whatnot.I've had 4-5 airport trips Sunday mornings many times with a 50% chance of catching someone for the drive back to downtown or Vieux Port, which is nice.When I need extra money I've done 40-50 hrs with UBER in the past and made $1000 in the week after gas costs. It's exhausting as hell, all that driving and chatting, but it's easily doable when you need quick $. Keep goals simple, aim for $200 in 8 hours and you'll have to do some evenings and the weekends for sure. Location (and a little luck) is also important.Note that on a bad day it's taken me 10 hrs to get my $200. You can't really control that.Hope this helps !MTLBiceps"
The NEW UBER experience - post pilot project,MTLBiceps,1682727,116359,Just one last comment - when I've needed extra cash and had 40-50 hrs I broke my week down as such:Monday - $150.00 (6-8 hours) dayTuesday - $150.00 (6-8 hours) dayWednesday - $150.00 (6-8 hours) dayThursday - $150.00 (6-8 hours) dayFriday $200.00 (8-10 hours) afternoon / eveningSaturday $200.00 (8-10 hours) noon till 8pm or 10pmSunday $200.00 (8-10 hours) 9am into afternoon$1200 after fuel costs. I typically estimate $25 - $30 a day and always aim for a few more trips after my goal has been completed for cover gas. So on a Saturday I'm actually aiming for $235.00 and that's calculated into my 8-10 hours.Note that I don't do nights and always try to be home for dinner (during the week and Sunday) as I have small children and enjoy spending time with themMTLBiceps

Beware that it sucks more data than the others (or so I've found).I recommend hanging out in the more English areas and you'll be okay. Downtown, Westmount, Cote de Neiges, TMR and anything west of Decarie.

I also open riders app to see how many UberX around me, each time I checked almost 5 to 6 pop up although none of them have uber sticker. So, my opinion is "" Uber is controlled by cabbies , almost all cabbies are uber driver and they take uberX pin while they are actually driving for cab company like diamond.... etc. Friend of mine who called for UberX today and one of taxi came to pick up him. He did not want to get in the taxi bcus he thought it was mistake, but cab driver replied to him"" don't worry I also drive for uber and he showed his pin to my friend . just wonder of Uber future in Montreal"

Ultimately it is very much common sense mixed in with a lot of road signs. It is multiple choice but often most of the answers are correct - the correct answer is which answer is MOST correct.I don't recall anything specific to the taxi industry in the exam - just questions pertaining to road code, highway safety, etc. It reminded me very much of taking my exam simply to get a drivers license.30 questions and took me roughly 15-20 min to complete. After that I waited in line to take a new picture for my license (which I received about a week later).I passed the test but not spectacularly.

I'v red about people trying it but only people in USA and I would like to know what is the situation in Montreal regarding this.Or if you didnt go with the Xchange Leasing program and didnt have a car what did you do ?Also, do you think that it is a good idea to Uber drive in Montreal or does the net gains after all expenses is just too low for all the hours put into it ? I understand it is very important to be strategic about when you choose to give ride but in a forum I'v seen someone say that in a city where the $/kilometer is below 1$ it is not worth giving it a try. On the Uber site of Montreal is says it is now 0,85$/kilo...Also, in terms of the futur of such an occupation in Montreal, what do you guys think ? Quebec, and particularly Montreal, being so leftist, I am scared the governement will regulate the hell out of this thing in a couple months and make it completely unappealable.Any other good information regarding becoming an uber driver in Montreal is welcomed !Thank you !"
Getting started as a driver in Montreal,crulee,620640,46565,"I do it it in my spare time. I just go out near home , I don't chase ""hot zones"". You have good days and bad days. But like I said because it's just supplemental income for me, there's no stress."
Getting started as a driver in Montreal,rics,685223,618187,"I just made my 100 rides in Montreal so I could give you some feedback on that. Started december, which ppl say it's a busy month, and driving a honda. You factor in gas and you end up doing like $8/hr (I track my fuel consumption with a plugin for the torque app).City rides are killing the mood, your regular ride brings you $7/ride gross, many of them even less than $5 ! You get calls at 2-3kms away just to make a ride for about the same distance. When getting calls you cannot choose if the ride is worth doing until you accepted the ride, uber doesn't show the distance of the clients's trip even if they have it in the system from the very beginning when clients placed the order.Even with the low cost of rides for the clients they still try to cheat you, asking for different stops and detours without updating the destinations for the driver to get paid. When you ask them to do that they give you shitty ratings. I can say that picking 2-3 drunken ppl from downtown and making unaccounted trips (""oh, few blocks away, buddy!"" kind of thing) to bring everybody home for $7 a ride is no fun at all.So if you really need the extra money it's ok. For clients is a great service, unbelievable cheap compared to the taxi. But with the real risk of car seisure and insurance liability you decide if it's worth $8/hour."

I'll make around 40$ after Uber's cut, but I put on my car around 80 kms (from the moment I leave home to the moment I come back).Revenu Quebec considers that using your car has a 0.54$ per km cost (gas, insurance, maintenance, depreciation, licence, etc.... ). So the calculation is simple :40$ - (80 * 0.54) = - 3.2So I am actually loosing money on a night like that. It's very important to consider all the expenses.Now, on a Friday night or Saturday night, with surges 2 and +, it starts to become interesting.Just my 2 cents.As for the Bureau du taxi, theses guys are the biggest clowns in town.

"Driving before Sept. 29, 2016",BigBarry,1503624,103474,"The actions of the Bureau du Taxi show the complete and utter corrupt nature of this City, and the actions of the city's worst mayor in 50 years. It is time to turf out Denis Coderre in 2017. This may be a legal loophole, but certainly was not the INTENT of the Minister of Transport, it is being exploited by the corrupt overpaid political hacks at City Hall, taking one last shot in their downward spiral. Now, according to the Highway Code, nobody is obliged to stop for a car with orange and yellow lights, only blue and red...only a police officer and not these roadside bylaw enforcement thugs have the power to impound a car...and they drive around in completely unmarked cars that show NO identification (even unmarked SPVM traffic cars have camouflaged markings). Denis Coderre has made this city a complete and utter laughingstock...he's against Canada Post, pit bulls, Uber, Cars2Go/CommunAuto, the unions, etc., etc. and wastes money on gazebos, can't get snow removed promptly, dumps sewage into the river. He is a Chris Christie wannabe without the credentials. Nothing like booting out tourists at the side of the road and having American talk radio say that Montreal is a third world city with a corrupt administration, with visitors phoning in to Howard Stern et al and saying that they will never return. Coderre even turned down the chance to appear on a national US travel radio show and reach something like a million listeners. Guess he was at a taxi company collecting a box of Sir Robert Borden portraits. A Paul Martin-era cabinet minister...from the sponsorship scandal days...And these rogue civil servants thinking that they'll take advantage of some loophole to have a joke at the Transport Minister's expense, they should be summarily fired and lose their pensions. Period. It's complete and utter insubordination. And do NOT, repeat do NOT, stop for any unmarked car with orange and yellow flashers...continue and call 911....the SPVM views this as a civil matter and basically think that these bylaw thugs are wannabe cops who failed at Nicolet and have about zero respect for them, particularly when they run stunts like this."

I told I don't understand on what proof he can do that and told again he suspects me. So they can ""arrest"" everyone and give a ticket and seize the car because of suspicion?The other inspector forced everyone to get out of the car afterwards and they acted like cops, all along.

UBER DRIVERS INSURANCE WARNING!,ksign,700787,50692,"from my experience, this has always been there.after sending multiple request to Uber about this, I understood that if you tell your insurance that you are using your vehicle for ""peer to peer"" services, they will simply discontinue your contract.in case you have an accident, Uber will always cover their users and drivers, even so there has been some past examples showing that it is not that simple.8th september 2015, Uber sent a message explaining that they were working on a partnership with Intact Corporation Financière insurance company.I guess they were willing to offer a better solution for Uber drivers than having to find a new insurance company every time they declare an accident with Uber to their personal insurance.since then, there has been no annoucement.I believe they have enought drivers that accomodate with this problem or are not aware of it.myself I stopped driving for Uber since I learned about this and am waiting for bettr condition to continue.it is important fore me to be able to use my car for personal purposes.the few money I earn with Uber is not worth loosing that ability."

Uber should be paying HST. Not the driver.,PoorBasterd,984043,71709,"Let's say you work for a temp agency. The agency sends you to it's client site to do work. The agency bills the client and from that payment the agency pays you and keeps a percentage for itself. In some temp assignments, you are expected to bring your own tools and equipment depending on the work. Now, when the billing time comes, who is supposed to charge the client the HST? You or the temp agency? Obviously the agency becausethe transaction is done with them, not with you.Cabbies are expected to get an HST number from CRA and remit HST on moneys collected over $30,000 per annum. Why them and not from Beck, Co-op, Able Atlantic or whoever? Becausethe transaction for the cab fare is done with the taxi driverand not with the dispatch company. The driver doesn't even have to take pax referrals from the dispatch company if he doesn't want to. In fact, he's fully allowed to have his own clients who can call him directly for transportation services.That's not the case with Uber. Uber Drivers: When was the last time you took direct payment from a pax for a ride, whether it be in cash or by credit/debit card? NEVER!The actual transaction is not done with us the driver: it's done directly with Uber.Uber then takes it's own cut and pays us according to the piece work we do for Uber's clients. In fact, Uber frowns upon us taking their clients off their system and dealing with them directly. As such, UBER is supposed to collect the HST since the point-of-sale is in their control...not ours. Those are NOT our clients: they're Uber's. We just ferry them to where they're going at Uber's behest.Same goes for UberCourier and UberEats. Uber is supposed to charge THEIR client the HST.

Vehicle seizures in Montreal,crulee,608739,45948,"I've been driving in Mtl-Laval area for a couple of months even though I signed up when Uber first came to town last year.I have a regular job in the evenings so I only drive in my spare time.I'm starting this thread to keep the MTL drivers more informed on car seizures.Reading the news, the taxi commission says they have seized over 400 cars. I find that number ridiculously high. Is it real or is it a scare tactic ?Anyone who has been seized please share your info and experience. Is it usually in the same area ?"
Vehicle seizures in Montreal,ThunderTrap,636583,45948,"I heard that they seize 20 cars a week...which is 2-4 a day...There are apparently only 2 Taxi Bureau inspectors for the whole island, and they seem to be totally downtown and in areas considered ""francophone"", because it would kill them to speak English. They dress like they are fighting ISIS, with bulletproof vests and camouflage pants, driving cars that look like they are with Securitas, because they are, in effect, failed students at Nicolet who couldn't make the real police force, now on the government payroll to collect the bribes for the worst Mayor that Montreal has seen in decades, a Chris Christie-wannabe without the bonafides, who has accomplished nothing in his 2 years in office. The real police HATE them, and are angry at the waste of time they entail for calling them to get approval to tow and impound a car, since it takes REAL police off the road to engage in what is really a civil action. In fact, SPVM officers have told me, unofficially, that they prefer Uber, have no problems with Uber drivers, that they find the system more professional and safer especially for single women. The only reason Coderre goes after Uber is because the taxi industry has been paying him off, and Uber hasn't ponied up to his coffers. This is a man who pays $1800/DAY for a consultant on Syrian refugees, money to some old party hack and crony, so he needs to find an American company to charge $530 tickets to. I have heard of clients, visiting Americans, who have been strong-armed and kicked out of Uber cars, stranded at 3AM in sketchy parts of town. One day one of those visitors is going to be raped and/or murdered, and that blood will solely be dripping from Coderre's chubby little fingers. I have seen countless posts on travel forums, heard American media talking about how backwards Montreal is, how they are in bed with entrenched monopolists who have pols on their payroll (note that the old separatist, Guy Chevrette, is on the lobby list for the taxi drivers, while the federalist, John Parisella, is for Uber). The city is going to Hell with infrastructure falling apart, tons of sewage being dumped into the river, restrictive language legislation, rising taxes...so what does the city go after but Uber! Righttttt....a minor league town in every respect. At my synagogue, we are now riding in the back seat when there are 2 of us...let these fake inspectors just TRY to pull us over and accuse us of being an Uber driver. They will see how fast that we sue them for millions, and make sure we run Coderre from office. Compared to him, Applebaum is a paragon of virtue."

Vehicle seizures in Montreal,Uberslop,689213,45948,"The number is so real. I remember sometimes I drove clients to airport seeing other uberees got the cars towed.ThunderTrap: your comments are so funny. But they have no problem upon any request from bureau de taxi. What you said is so subjective about the hatred of police over btmIf you drive around downtown ( where you have most requests,) btm is waiting on renelevesque o, st laurent, beaver hall, Sherbrooke, avenu du parc, try not to confront with taxi drivers cuz then they report your plate, it will be in the system.I used to drive for uber but gas price, fare cuts, and the risk of being charged as criminal doing illegal transports ... discourage me."
Vehicle seizures in Montreal,Arnel,704766,45948,"Salut les amis!Just wondering how the bureau de taxi inspectors are able to stop and seize the vehicles? They are not peace officers, couldn't an uber just drive away?Cheers and Uber on!"

And this saturday night, they did not towed cars, but were deducting 4 points on drivers licence. Are the parking full? BE CAREFUL GUYS"
Vehicle seizures in Montreal,Uberchampion,870066,45948,Why are they taking points off license?
Vehicle seizures in Montreal,Uberslop,871482,45948,"As I said, three knocks and you will be gone. There are drivers getting busted for 7 times and uber paid for all tickets. So good luck."
Vehicle seizures in Montreal,BigBarry,1376233,45948,"The Taxi Inspectors cars only have yellow lights. It is only required by law to stop for a car with red and blue lights. The Taxi Inspectors are basically the same as city by-law enforcers, same as giving a ticket for putting garbage out the wrong day or not having a dog license. Remember, in 2017, vote for anyone but Coderre as my esteemed cusin ThunderTrap told you above."
Uber should be paying HST. Not the driver.,,71710,0,
Uber should be paying HST. Not the driver.,PoorBasterd,984053,71710,"Let's say you work for a temp agency. The agency sends you to it's client site to do work. The agency bills the client and from that payment the agency pays you and keeps a percentage for itself. In some temp assignments, you are expected to bring your own tools and equipment depending on the work. Now, when the billing time comes, who is supposed to charge the client the HST? You or the temp agency? Obviously the agency becausethe transaction is done with them, not with you.Cabbies are expected to get an HST number from CRA and remit HST on moneys collected over $30,000 per annum. Why them and not from Beck, Co-op, Able Atlantic or whoever? Becausethe transaction for the cab fare is done with the taxi driverand not with the dispatch company. The driver doesn't even have to take pax referrals from the dispatch company if he doesn't want to. In fact, he's fully allowed to have his own clients who can call him directly for transportation services.That's not the case with Uber. Uber Drivers: When was the last time you took direct payment from a pax for a ride, whether it be in cash or by credit/debit card? NEVER!The actual transaction is not done with us the driver: it's done directly with Uber.Uber then takes it's own cut and pays us according to the piece work we do for Uber's clients. In fact, Uber frowns upon us taking their clients off their system and dealing with them directly. As such, UBER is supposed to collect the HST since the point-of-sale is in their control...not ours. Those are NOT our clients: they're Uber's. We just ferry them to where they're going at Uber's behest.Same goes for UberCourier and UberEats. Uber is supposed to charge THEIR client the HST. That's not our responsibility."
Uber should be paying HST. Not the driver.,UberxGTA,1317266,984053,"Sounds like a class action suit is necessary. Uber doesn't write the laws, even if they would like to. Uber drivers are not mandated to submit HST. Officially it is still only regulated taxi fares and limo services. UberX is not part of that and the CRA is still behind the times just like most municipal by laws. Don't be and Uberfool if you are submitting a non-mandated tax voluntarily just because Uber is trying to evade their responsibilities."
Uber should be paying HST. Not the driver.,Uberslop,1365276,71710,You are so wrong on 30k hst. Any product or service are more than 1$ are subject for hst tax

"Front seat, do you ask?",,64247,0,
"Front seat, do you ask?",Mtlwi,877426,64247,"Last week, game night, ping, ndg, came to the address, just before he goes for the back seat I asked him politely, pretty please, front seat because of all the problems that can come on our way.Rude NO from him as he entered the car and started giving me s....on French.This kind of situation is why I never start a trip before the pax gets in the car.Asked him politely to exit the car because I won't drive him. He suddenly started apologizing on English, but it was to late. Rating would be 1* for sure. Picked a great ride in 2 min after.O yeah, did I mention the guy was late for the game."
"Front seat, do you ask?",ubermontreal,881402,64247,"I always lock the back doors, and I drive away if you want to sit in the back.As well, speaking of the french thing. I simply state ""Bonjour Monsieur, Je suis Anglophone, Je pas comprix la francais"" And if they respond in French. ""Monsieur, svp requester une nouvelle uber, pour le francais chaffeur"" but like - you don't need to speak someones language to drive them in Uber anyway...just enter your dest - lets go."
"Front seat, do you ask?",Uberslop,882330,64247,"Why do you guys provoke language issue?I speak mostly french and I find that french are not arrogant like that.When you apply to uber in montreal, they should make french a prerequisite."
"Front seat, do you ask?",ubermontreal,882449,882330,"Oh really?""French are not arrogant like that"". Like the cop that pulled up beside me to ask me why I was parked in front of my own house with the vehicle running last night, (When I was warming the car), guess he thought I was dealing or something? I asked him 4 times to speak to me in English, before he would.I've had people be rude to me for speaking French. Why should you speak a language to drive for Uber? Deaf people drive for Uber across the US, it's a system where you see an address, you get in and you drive to it. I don't need to do any discussion for it.Jeez"
"Front seat, do you ask?",Uberslop,882892,64247,You refuse to speak French and you pass judgement to the cop.Anyway I'm not a cops fan but language should not be a problem in service industry.Have u ever visited a resto that waiters replied to you in french while you asked them in English?
"Front seat, do you ask?",ubermontreal,883014,882892,"Man, I'm not gonna create a language issue out of nothing.There's deaf drivers for Uber, you don't need to speak the same language to drive someone. By the way, I speak passable french, I just find it hard to understand others french."
"Front seat, do you ask?",Mtlwi,883619,64247,"First I have to apologize for not being clear about the French, English is not my first language, in fact, I'm in Canada for 15 month's now. Don't speak French, but the main reason for what I came to Montreal is for me and my kids to learn French (wife knows)I'm Ubering because everyone needs money, but also to have a working social experience, get to know this city, people, so to integrate. The guy was rude English or French, don't care. My point was that you should never start trip before you check out what's going on with your rider.Because you can't get rated then, and off in the night you go without a problem.1am downtown, ping, rider 4.9, sandwich bar, drunk not so much, OK, let's go, but he's waiting for two more friends who are much more drunk, story short,It was surge all over, but no, I'm stuck with two drunks waiting for the third-party."
"Front seat, do you ask?",Mtlwi,883669,64247,"O yeah, they were Americans"
"Front seat, do you ask?",Thatendedbadly,883676,0,"So, you tell all of your pax they have to sit in the front with you? Don't the women get creeped out?"
"Front seat, do you ask?",ubermontreal,883708,883676,"Yes, it's unfortunate - but I can't take people in the backseat or I risk being seized seconds later.Uber takes care of everything for you, BUT your disabled for that evening. So you get seized Friday @ 9PM? you've lost out on $xxx earnings that you would have made..."
"Front seat, do you ask?",ubermontreal,883712,883619,"Welcome to Quebec, Here we are very bilingual - Don't worry about speaking French or English, just do your best. I wasn't trying to create a language issue here, I always ask to be served in English, and when requested in the Uber will do my very best to serve someone in French, after asking them if they could possibly speak English, as it's my most comfortable language. If they refuse, no issue, I'll speak very basic french to confirm destination, ask if we're at the right address, and ask them how they are doing. (And really, no other conversation is needed so its ok)"
"Front seat, do you ask?",Another Uber Driver,902498,64247,"When I lived up there, I spoke whatever the other person spoke to me, first. Funny thing, though, when I used to come back from vacations in the EEUU, the Customs men would address me in French first, followed immediately by English. I always answered in French, but then they would start speaking English. I never could figure out that one. Perhaps it had something to do with some of the Belgian characteristics of my French? I never asked.I never could learn to trill my ""r"" in French, though, even though I speak Italian and do not have the ""erre moscia"".If you put the passenger in the back, up there, the Pepe grabs your car?"

Tips for Driving in MTL,,64593,0,
Tips for Driving in MTL,ubermontreal,883215,64593,"Please guys....Follow these tips& we will seeLESS SEIZURES&LESS TAXI ISSUES.I do Uber almost full time, and am making a decent income from it here in Montreal. But, that can only continue if I'm not constantly getting seized because of STUPID things PAX do (and other drivers areencouragingthis behaviour""1. Please make sure PAX sit in front if they are travelling to/from downtown / high traffic areas. If they ask to sit in the back, tell them that we don't offer back seats in an Uber because of the current climate in Montreal - If they decline, simply ask them to call another Uber or Taxi.I text ALL PAX, ""Hi there, thanks for choosing Uber, I'm happy to give you an awesome ride today. Mind, doing me a huge favour ~ and making sure someone is seated up front?""2. Don't pickup inside the WESTIN/Other hotels. I know they have an entrance, but if you enter them the cabbies will be there & will give you crap... Same with going into the train station, I've seen many seizures of cars just pulling out of the train loop to loop. There is a comfortable entrance across from Hotel Bonaventure that you can suggest & almost all pax will love.3. When confronted by a taxi driver, I find it best to say ""Excuse moi monsieur, c'est mon ami"" when he accuses you of being Uber (even happens with front seat pax), if they continue to harass, I simply state ""Je telephone 911, I'm not sure what you're issue is, but I'm not with Uber"". It's better not to say I'm Uber because they can react violently.I have reports of taxi drivers trying to ram our cars, and I've personally been tapped on the shoulder by a taxi driver.Just some tips- ALSO if you pull up to a CLUB and the people aren't immediately ready, pull into a parking spot and turn off car, even if its a block or two up, you should not be waiting with 4ways on on st cats / st laurent, this will easily get you seized.. same thing with ST PAUL, crescent etc.Just a thought..."

Driving in the west island,ksign,874842,63961,"FYI, I stopped driving for Uber after 3 weeks trial.

Uber said they were working with Intact Corporation Financière back in september 2015 but no news since then.At the time, I had one run to the west island. it was a very good one because I had a group of teenagers who asked me to drop them sequentially to their respective houses.

tips to avoid taxi police in montreal.,,53191,0,
tips to avoid taxi police in montreal.,Uberslop,718172,53191,"Guys!If ur ubering in montreal, sometimes you got stopped by btm (bureau de taxi) even without clients. Well, your plate is booked. 2015 alone, btm towed 900 UBERX.Tip 1:Don't be fooled by uber supporting media, we are doing illegal client transportation. SO Don't do it obvious. Recently, Uber's app changes the ping sound for that reason. HIDE YOUR SMART PHONE!Tip 2:TRY NOT TO CONFRONT TAXIS. Some of my friends picked up clients right in front of taxi stand. Immagine that they pay 7$/h just to sit in that car and look at their clients gone. Taxi drivers took the pictures of your plates then reported to btm. You are cooked. Soon or later, btm agents will stop you. ( my own experience)Tip 3Downtown is dangerous. It is up to you. No risk no gain.Tip 4Never trust clients.Recently, btm hired 120 clients to take uber and taxi service. ( read the news) They dress in normal fits and are always busy with their ''smart phones''. Chance is that nothing will be happening at the end but they know who u r and the car you drive.Tip 5.If you are cooked, after the verdicts, even uber pays everything, don't Uber again. If you got 3rd times, you are criminal. Period. My lawyer told me that (of course uber lawyer never said, but i consult my good private lawyer.) If you are screwed ONCE, don't even think of driving class 1 license up grade. You are some kind of criminal for illegal transport in SAAQ file. Uber is not helping you on that.These are facts. My own experience. Being well-informed is better than nothing.Good luck!If you have more tips pls post here to help our fellows. Thanks!"

They would not be suspended and we would not lose any points.Would you be able to elaborate a bit on how what the SAAQ does after an uber driver gets towed?I will send an email to uber asking this question directly as well.Cheers!"

Undercover riders,Uberslop,843066,61751,This is why driving for uber is riskier than you think.Yes they can cancel your plate if they request saaq. Everything is for 4.50$ /hr
Undercover riders,Fred1278,843335,843066,As I see. You're not a driver
Undercover riders,Uberslop,843437,843335,I used to be a driver but not anymore since I got my car towed by bureau taxi right on renelevesque. Anyway you should drive for 1 year like I did and0 understand what I said.I drove since uber first came to montreal and there was no surge. The office was on renelevesque in nouvel hotel. The price was very good and never had any issue with taxi like we do now.I even get problem with revenue qc since I did not declare uber earning.Driving for uber is very additive I know.If u don't appreciate my advices just ignore them. Stop giving bias guess.

Calculating CCA for a leased vehicle?,mtl514,845289,62049,"Can you guys help me out with the CCA part of the form T2125 ?Let's say the MSRP is $20,000 and I drove for Uber in the first 6 months of the lease ending in Dec 31. My persona/business is 50/50. How would I go about inputting the numbers?Do I put in the full MSRP amount under capital cost (area A)? What about area B?"

Calculating CCA for a leased vehicle?,mtl514,847535,62049,What's with the lol? I just found out CCA doesn't apply to leased vehicles.
Calculating CCA for a leased vehicle?,YULberXer,847603,62049,the lol is because your question seems like advanced tax accounting to me. I'd be surprised if you will find that level of accounting knowledge / sophistication in this group. most of us will be filing Uber income tax for the first time ever next month.
Calculating CCA for a leased vehicle?,mtl514,847639,847603,"Why next month? Should get started now and file it for next week. Unless your missing your T4's RL's..The CCA or capital cost allowance is for vehicles bought and not for leased vehicles which I learned on redflagdeals personal finance forum.PS: I came at a loss (high 1xx) for 2015, good thing I quit on new years."

Calculating CCA for a leased vehicle?,Fred1278,850348,62049,"Just saying but it is very up to us. Uber doesn't send any document to the government because, officially, it is not a Canadian industry. So, if you declare less or more, they won't even know."
Calculating CCA for a leased vehicle?,Uberslop,850517,850348,Revenue qc promised to hammer uber driver. Uber gd said uber drivers are responsible for tax due.All transactions are tracable since your banks are Canadian firms. I don't know how to do it properly.
Calculating CCA for a leased vehicle?,mtl514,850683,850348,"Fred, CRA is has already stated they will crack down on people making money via AirBnb and Uber. It's pretty easy for them to pull up all your transactions. It's better to file them now (declare loss) and pay nothing than to be audited in the future and pay penalties.and as Uberslop pointed out, RQ didn't raid Uber offices for nothing. They may or may not have your info already, it's better to be safe than sorry."
Calculating CCA for a leased vehicle?,Fred1278,850724,62049,"Yea of course. Thank you for the informations.I don't know for you guys, but when I calculated and considering the gaz and the tax incomes, it's like 12$/h (the car is paid)."

Accountant to file my tax.The other day when I saw tout monde en parle, uber gd said if you earn more than 30k then you have to pay the tax for uber. After I did my tax caculation, driving for uber made me into higher tax bracket. Better to let professional handle the file than to out-smart those agencies."

Montreal DUI Checkpoints,,49090,0,
Montreal DUI Checkpoints,ubermontreal,655309,49090,"Hey,So without giving too much information, within the past couple weeks I was stopped on Nun's Island at a DUI checkpoint (and just missed one in Hochelaga a few weeks ago). I was on my way to pick up a PAX, and being that I live in Verdun, thought nothing of going through a DUI checkpoint.The cop stops me, and asks me whether I drink, I gave him my unique response that it's against my religious beliefs to drink so I do not drink ever. He gave me a dirty look for responding to him in English, and then proceeded to play a game of 20 questions with me, all the while checking his light through my car... He asked me for my exact destination, I response I am going to Nuns Island, he said no this is Nuns island, I responded yes I know... He wanted to know the exact address and how long I was going to be there for?.I found this to be quite a confusing experience as I've been through many checkpoints and usually they just want to hear ""a friends house"" and I live in such/such neighbourhood but this guy wanted full details.I had just enough time to push the button to close my screen when I saw the cops but the entire time the cop was staring at my mounted phone. I'm sure he was wondering if I was an Uber driver.For other drivers in Montreal, since it's still ""technically illegal"", how would you respond to a DUI checkpoint as I'm sure we will have to go to many more. Do you say this is an Uber... if you have PAX in the car, or do you say that it's just you and some friends?Thoughts welcome...Would love to see more Montreal drivers on here as well."
Montreal DUI Checkpoints,Krz,656913,49090,"Usually they just tell me to dont drink and drive when I pass them around 7pm. On a solo ride I always ask my PAX to sit in the front, on a DUI i will probably just tell them im driving a friend home."
Montreal DUI Checkpoints,Another Uber Driver,678610,0,"Asteure, j'habit pas a Montreal, mais j'y habitais quand que j'etais jeune homme........................One thing that I always did when I lived there was respond in the language that was spoken to me first. It was a lesson that two Customs Men at Gare Central taught me the first time that I went there. I went to get my suitcase. The Customs man pointed to a row of suitcases and asked me ""Which one is yours?"" I pointed to one and replied ""La rose est la mienne"". Another Customs Man stared at me when he heard my Belgian accented French while the first one went to fetch the suitcase and examine it and my documents. When they saw that I was an American they told me that always I should answer in the language in which I was first addressed. It was obvious that the first Customs Man was an Anglophone, the second Francophone. After that, I followed that advice and it worked well. When I was first there, my Belgian accent was more prominent, so sometimes people would switch to English. Eventually, I started to speak Montreal French, but I have retained a few peculiarities of the Belgian French. I am not Belgian, but I did have a Belgian mathematics teacher in high school who tutored me mathematics in French.This is a tri-state area, here, so we do deal with pickups in different jurisdictions. There is one jurisdiction that does not allow outside taxicabs to pick up there. If I do have to pick up someone there, I put him into the front seat, put up myOFF DUTYsign, note it on a dummy trip sheet and haul him. I explain the situation to him and tell him to tell the Prince George's County Police that he is my friend and that we are going to Providence Hospital or something like that. I do turn on the meter (this was much easier when we did not have meters in Washington from 1931-2008). The only outward sign that the meter is running is a dark top light, but the driver can also turn his top light dark. On some lights, the meter will go on despite the drivers' setting the top light to ""dark"".What I would do is put the passenger into the front seat. Explain the situation to the passenger. Star the trip. Put the UberFONE into the glove box. If the Pepe do stop you, the passenger will know to say that you are his or her friend and you are headed to Le Nelson, Nun's Island, Verdun, Longueil, McGill, Sud-Ouest, Notre Dame-Maisonneuve or wherever."

"Montreal, Canada",Yul,487909,34885,"Ya, made over $1500 in a weekend. Long rides to Parc Jean Drapeau and 2X-4X all the time. It was pretty amazing. I even refused Select calls since the surge on X was so high. I didn't work during Grand Prix but I spoke to drivers who said they made more than that then.Ever got pulled over by the taxi bureau or cops? Remember that taxi bureau officers are not peace officers and you can just drive away, they don't have authority to arrest or detain. Best bet would be to drive into an indoor parking lot, park it and go have lunch.What are some of your challenges in the Montreal?"
"Montreal, Canada",mtl514,488693,487909,"Wow, unbelievable! How much did you take home after everything including taxes? How many hours in total?Never got pulled over, still a newbie in the game though. Thanks for the advice.Challenges, well, the construction is a major one. So far the language issue hasn't come up, maybe because I am bilingual... Let's see.. short rides in downtown are the worst, from a bar on St-Laurent to their residence on McKay.. but they add up I guess. Airport is starting to become a pain in the rear, drop off, either drive into Dorval (dawson/carson) and wait for ride or go to industrial area in lachine and slowly work my way on the 20E. But so far, I have been lucky to get a ride within 10minutes of airport drop.Do you work full time or part time? What are your hours? I work part time, mostly during day, weekend nights sometimes. Don't drive past 12am, my preference. Don't like dealing with the drugged/drunk crowds."
"Montreal, Canada",Yul,489143,34885,"That amount was after taxes, gaz and wear/tear + tax deduction. In other words, net. About 28 hours of work over 4 days. On Monday, I was just driving back and forth from the airport. It was worth coming back empty right away since I knew I'd get a ride back at 2X.For navigation and traffic, only use Waze. It's very accurate for road closures and shortcuts using side streets. It should connect directly to the Driver app. Do not use the Uber app for navigation, it's garbage and makes you take ridiculous routes. Locals think you're screwing them. Google Maps is ok too but I found it to be less accurate with road closures.There will always be short rides, but so many times I'll do a shirt ride into a neighbourhood I rarely go to and I get a huge ride from there (airport, 450, etc.). But if not, it does add up. You could also give them your number and ask them to call you if they ever want a long ride. Just be sure to make them up the app to pay you, always safer.Airport is tricky. When do you normally go there? You can't legally pickup from airport and there are taxi bureau guys there, I typically see someone getting pulled over a few times a month. Here's what I suggest: riders will try to get a taxi from the airport but the app won't let them, they'll then move the address nearby and call the driver to tell them they're at the airport. The stupid driver picks them up at the airport. The smart ones, ask the client to hop onto the FREE shuttle bus to any of the airport hotels (closest ones are Aloft and Sheraton) and pick them up there. That's so much safer and will keep you out of trouble. Best place at the airport to get a call is in the ""cell phone lot"" since its closest to the terminal. If not, you can actually drive 5 minutes to DDO or Fairview and although you may have to wait 20-30 minutes, you'll get a $45-50 drive back to downtown. Other option is the Via train station in Dorval which gets a few calls each hour.I usually work daytime, some nights but rarely. I did a few 11pm-4am shifts simply out of curiosity and I must say I made a ton of money, lots of Surge and long rides. The clients aren't so bad as long as u refuse riders under 4.6. Lots of calls in Mile End, Plateau and Rosemont at night. They usually go back home in the 450. It should be busy around the bell centre during hockey nights also. I work part time now although I was doing full time in the summer. I average $30 hour but I very carefully pick the times I work. (Morning Rush hour, dinnertime, Mondays and Fridays daytime is busy downtown/village/old mtl)What type of car do you have? I'll look out for you. Which areas seem to work well for you? Here are my top 5 hoods:- Outremont (wait long for a call but usually a long one)- Côte St Luc/Hampstead- Verdun- Ahunstic/Cartierville- near the Stadium daytimeWorst:- Downtown between 6pm-11pm (the short rides you were describing)- Old Montreal nighttime (tourists going back to hotels downtown usually)- Plateau on Saturday/Sunday daytime (locals running errands, short rides)- Laval or South Shore (you could wait over 1-2 hours for a call)- Airport past 6pm (almost no flights landing)I'll write about the referral program at some point. It's amazing if you know how to promote it well, I haven't paid to use Uber as a passenger in months since I get 3-5 rides a week for free.We'll get into the score too, I'll tell you about a few tricks to keep it high. It's all about the clients you drive. In short, the higher their rating, the higher your rating. And there is a belief out there that Uber sends a call to higher scores, I think it's true since I tested it myself.Need any other tips for Montreal? Feel free to ask. The more we chat, hopefully other 514s will join us in our thread! Drive safe"
"Montreal, Canada",ZoomZoomZoom,514784,34885,thanks for all the info YUL.yeah im finding it tricky to pick a schedule to work. the weekends like you said can sometimes be troubling. But i havent had any major issues except a vehicle clean request.im try to switch to days and see if its different compared to nights.
"Montreal, Canada",Yul,516766,34885,"its been a little quiet the last couple of weeks, mostly because (I think) of less tourists and more drivers on the road. It's still pretty busy on evenings and rush hour though.You do know you can refuse passengers if you feel they're going to mess up your car or cause trouble. When it's busy and calls come in fast, I usually don't accept pings from passengers who are under 4.6"
"Montreal, Canada",ZoomZoomZoom,517150,34885,"i suppose in the beginning i was desperate to learn ropes fast, so i took every call that came in regardless of the distance away.the one deterrent is that a few times i had a rider request a trip and he was 12 minutes away. by the time i was 4 minutes away, they cancelled.I know we dont get paid for the trip there (which we should) pro-rated of course.. but there should be some kind of penalty to the rider.. possibly an automatic self 1 star lol.. i dunno.. its just frustrating. like i understand if i get there and u dont show, least i get 5$ lol... but to have traveled so far for them to just cancel really pissed me off..what shall i do in this scenario ? in hindsight i suppose i should have paid more attention to their user score; but at the same time sometimes pretty shitty ppl have high ratings.. as most drivers (least i do) 5 star everyone. Unless you're a complete tard. I'll give a 2 or 3 rating.like a few weeks ago, a guy i picked up i had asked him to empty their beers before getting in my car. One guy did, but the back passenger (I now know) had snuck it into his bag, and was drinking it behind me. ten minutes in i hear a thud in the back.. like something fell.. when i dropped them off i then started smelling beer, and realized wow my entire back seat is soaked. Uber did reimburse me the cleaning fee, but still... ppl like this i give a 1 star too.i mean if i had gotten pulled over, and i had no idea what my passenger was doing, i imagine i am responsible for them ? the guy who ordered the uber was fine, it was just his friend, and i felt bad reporting it, but hey that guy should have cared what his friend was doing. It cost me $28 to clean, and uber deposited $100 into my account.Rider had a hard lesson that night. hopefully the two of them are still friends..wow.. this was a total rant.. sorry"
