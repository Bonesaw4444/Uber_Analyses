"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",StuffinMuffin,Themoreyouus,0,"I figured this would be the case.  With the introduction of upfront pricing, Uber can charge customers anything they want.  They will ask for any amount riders are willing to pay.  I have heard cases where during the hours when the business users are out, the overall fare goes up.  Trips to and from airports? You guessed it.  It'll go up because people are willing to pay.All the cheap Uber fares that we have gotten accustomed to are about to go out the window.  Regulators and law makers who shoved the taxis out.  Are you happy now?  What about those Uber fans who said, ""Uber is better and cheaper.  Screw the taxis.  Stronger survives.""  So irresponsible.  Here's the proof:""Uber appears to have the opposite of a rewards program. That is, it appears the more you use Uber as a passenger, the more they’re going to charge you per mile. Weknow Uber said they were going to experimenton charging different customers different rate, based on a variety of unpublished factors. My current belief is the more you use the service in a way that suggests you can afford more, the more they will charge you.""https://therideshareguy.com/uber-is-ripping-off-frequent-riders-and-heres-how-to-avoid-it/"
"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",LavishHaze,20047,Themoreyouus,Uber is such a shitty company. I’ve spent more on Uber than than my actual travel. One time it was around the time 5pm and normally my fare is aboit $50 and suddenly it jumped to $170. That’s a huge jump then I waited 5-10 minutes then it went to $80 and then back at $50. What kind of bullshit is that? That is more than double my original fair?  That’s 350% more. Wtf! There excuse of more in demand is such bullshit because if I wait 5 min the price changes. It’s just to see if people are willing to pay high in panic of pretending as if the customer won’t get a Uber in time. It’s no different than online shopping and then say “12 people have this in their cart” or “this item is about to sell out” wait the 5-10 minutes and you’ll see how the price goes down. Uber knows what they’re doing.

"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",reliablerider,19945,Themoreyouus,The cost of a ride from a ride-sharing app like Uber or Lyft has increased in recent years. Many riders have also noticed increased wait times for rides. The main reason may be shortage of drivers.

"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",FitBitMeIn,3139,Themoreyouus,"What a tactic.  Uber initially set the prices of rides VERY low to undercut taxi companies.  Now that the taxi industry is in shambles, they decide to raise the fares to whatever they want.Soon, I am sure Uber will be more expensive than taxis.  Why wouldn't they, right? They dominate the market now.Uber's taxi takeover has been completed successfully.  Congratulations!!!!"
"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",scotchyscotchyscotch,3186,3139,This is an age-old tactic. Predatory pricing. It was especially effective in this case since the taxis couldn't even try to compete since their pricing is regulated.If you ask me the local governments screwed this up. They should have regulated Uber when they had the chance. The cat's out of the bag now.

"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets.

"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",SmittenKitten,3207,3181,"The reason the taxi industry couldn't respond was that they aren't centrally owned or managed.  It was all distributed and locally regulated.  There were some strong entities and large unions like NYC/TLC, Pittsburgh, and mega-taxi companies in Chicago, but they were not able to respond, build a technology stack/platform, and have the large enough influence like Uber could.Uber was also working on a leverage and had access to billions of dollars (to spend on lobbyists, etc.) while the taxi companies were working for a profit, and a thin one at that."

(Because it was busy) I immediately changed the destination address (a hospital that is front of my job) and the fare was $30 !!!!😐Wow, they are really taking advantage of people necessity.  Luckily I got my car back from the mechanic."
"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",AsStibelDude,18876,18818,"Haven't you heard? Uber can charge whatever they want now.Basically, Uber charges whatever the rider is willing to pay.It isn't based on time and distance anymore.Uber quietly has updated their official pricing policy, and they updated their websites and disclaimers too.Do you know what's really messed up? The drivers aren't even told how much the rides are, and they are only paid a negotiated rate based on time and distance.  So they get paid the same amount regardless of what the riders are paying. It's not a percentage anymore."

"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",Marc88,3176,3138,"Yes, it’s capitalism. Late capitalism is all about monopolization, the dominance of consolidated wealth, and the leverage of accumulated capital which has actually eroded competition, diminished the marketplace, and as predicted by Marx, destroyed private property (the fruits of individual labor), the opposite of what it started out to do.

"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",JustinCavalucci,18587,Themoreyouus,Uber has gotten wayy too expensive and much more difficult to even locate a driver. I don't know what the hell happened but it used to be so easy and so affordable. Now its unbelievable complicated and the prices are fuckin out rageous. I needed to go just 5 mins down the street by car to the grocery store. Uber was trying to charge me $25-30!?!?! The item I needed to get from the store was only $6!!! That is fuckin insane.
"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",DDominico69,18875,18587,"Now that Uber has successfully taken over the taxi industry and forced most existing companies to bankruptcy, it's time for them to raise their prices. Their goal (that everyone knew) has always been to grab the monopoly.Not to mention the economics of taxis have never been a highly profitable business. Uber disrupted an industry that was already established, with drivers and dispatchers. It was alreday working with very low margin.  They removed it, and replaced it. It was basically just a deregulation.The problem is they added more bureaucracy to this where the company takes a huge cut (over 28%) of every ride even though they claimed to have created efficiency. We are all now facing the reality that the prices have to be raised to pre-Uber levels. Oh, you will see."
"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",JudgeItoh,3136,Themoreyouus,"yeaha, that whole upfront pricing bit was spun as something nice and noble for users who wanted to know about the fare beforehand.  but the truth was that Uber wanted to charge more money and not base it on publicly posted fares.This is much closer to getting quotes from Limos companies.and it's worse because Uber will charge you whatever they want to.  whatever you are willing to pay.  and it'll be different betweeen personal and business travelers, rich and poor, affluent neighborhood to poorer neighborhood, time of day, etc."

"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",otisburg10,18072,Themoreyouus,Taxis are under municipal price control. Uber is not. Uber is known for surge pricing. Uber is known for being dishonest. What do you think Uber will do once all their competition is driven to the ground? They will probably charge at least $20 per mile and many people will be sorry they ever supported those fascist pricks.
"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",HuhnHuhn,3067,Themoreyouus,"Right.  They can charge anything they want, which means no more deals.  Someone told me about the example of trips between Heathrow and London. You pretty much have no choice except a car service and maybe the train.  Well, they won't charge those friendly uberX prices for those."

Since Uber won't give you details of trip; but, does assign you as closest to the call, Uber should then compensate you for going to where ever they are sending you. Whether the victim of a cancellation after driving 20 minutes to the pickup point, or the pickup is a two miles to the store ride. So the compensation should be two part. Drivers original location to pickup point and then pickup point to destination. If the driver reaches the pickup point, they are guaranteed compensation for that leg, no matter the outcome of the ride. Whether Uber wants to eat that addition to the drivers income or pass it on to the consumer, is up to them.If Uber assigns a ride that makes someone drive twenty minnutes to complete the task on Uber's behalf, then it is only right that they cover that cost of getting there.I think Uber should reduce it's take from the drivers money to a strict 15% of gross revenue and look for alternative revenue streams to make up the difference. For example the Unlimited 25% Club. Pay an annual membership of $49.99 and get a flat 25% off all your Uber rides. Use as many times as you like during the membership period.

Thus the company sets the rate of the ""gate"" fee the drivers pay to take out a car and in exchange they are only responsible for paying for gas while they use the car.No one gets rich in the taxi business, least of all any drivers, even those who own medallions which allow them to rent their car to another driver and for them to drive without paying the full ""gate"", the price to take out a car. Those drivers still pay a modest fee to the company for the use of the company color scheme painted on the car as well as access to the dispatcher.An Uber driver, by comparison is responsible for all costs and pays Uber a commission for access to the ""dispatch"" system, which is fully automated by computer and accessed only through a smart phone.If I had absolute power I would merge all the taxi companies into Uber, deal with the city authorities in a non adversarial manner and provide a service that was superior to the original taxi cab services and paid the drivers better than the current Uber model does.However, in order to do that, they would have to create a better incentive for drivers to stay out all night long, perhaps by accepting a much lower commission from drivers between the hours of 3AM and 6AM in order to keep cars on the road.The prices as they are today should probably rise by 50%-75% in order to be fair to the drivers as well as all the investors waiting to recoup the money they gave Uber to start up.Read less..."

They instead took the selfish take-over route, where they went head-on, and tried to own the industry.Some people argue that taxi companies wouldn't have played the game and that they would have slow down the growth of Uber. However, Grab, Ola, Didi, 99 and Meru are all doing great jobs at merging with local taxi companies.  Sure, there are hiccups, disputes, and people clashing, but as a result, they have grown quickly and established roots in massive markets.  Uber?  not so much.So what's next?  Will there be an implosion with where the fare stands today?  Will there be a reckoning day?   ...or will Autonomous Vehicles save the day by eliminating the driver pay?  Will the consumers take the blunt by paying more tips?  Will Didi and Ola take over the North American market by merging taxi companies (including Flywheel and Cubr) and bring down Uber/Lyft?What an exciting time to be alive.Read less..."

I quickly quit doing that unless there was a surge.Similar analysis of driving my Prius revealed that the grand total of my net, after-cost earnings over 4 months to be about $6 / hour even though I had originally thought I was making almost $14 / hour after incentives.  Yes - factoring in costs, I made less than minimum wage.So in essence, Uber and Lyft were exploiting my ignorance of what my true costs were going to be.  That's why I say that the business models of both companies are unsustainable. Both companies are betting on driverless vehicles rescuing them from the low fare prices they're charging riders - but I don't think they can keep finding new drivers to replace their former drivers (like me) forever.There will be a day of reckoning, and if I were CEO, I'd be worried that it might come sooner than later and before autonomous vehicles arrive.  So that would be my top priority.Read less..."

No longer accepting idiots who try to do UberX or UberPOOL with a Mercedes C300 and then complain about the costs to drive! Higher pay and lower costs result in an actual profitable business. From there, I work to expand the business from a healthier footing.This would probably be very unpopular with investors and affect the valuation of the company in a negative way, since this strategy ultimately pulls back from the goal of making transportation “flow like water” to everybody and it hurts the network effects of having an almost unlimited supply of cars and drivers on the platform.I would combat that though with a heavy focus on Jump, a dockless pedal-assisted bikeshare company that Uber recently acquired. These bikes (and similar products) would be a the future in making transportation and mobility accessible to everyone. In the long term, the bikes would likely be a lot cheaper than drivers and offer a higher profit margin by taking the driver and their expensive car out of the equation. As a driver myself, I would be glad to pass off these short-distance, minimum fare rides to the bikes. I would also continue investing heavily in autonomous vehicles because that’s just the future.That’s pretty simple to say online. I guess that’s why I’m not the CEO of anythingRead less..."

So the company isn't even making the money, and that's probably why they feel justified to pay the drivers too little.but I agree with you.  Rideshares is just a commodity.  It's the drivers and their cars are the ASSET and create REVENUE.   (This reminds me of a consulting company where the company is nothing but a shell.)   So without drivers there'd be nothing.  Again, it's a commodity.  If all drivers got up and decided to move over to another company with a separate software, they can.  In a single day.  Leaving Uber in the dust.Uber should just be a software platform that connects people P2P-style.  Just let it be a software that people can download for a few bucks.  Like Napster and Torrents.  True Peer-to-Peer.  Is that too much to ask?"

The taxi cab companies are feeling the impact but at the same time ride share companies have picked up the low life scum bag bottom fishers as customers because of cheap rates.I'm a driver based out of Los Angeles I drive a 2018 luxury SUV.  I never do pools I will only do an UberX or Lyft  If there is a 2.0  Surge for higher in that location.  The rates for Uber XL and Lyft XL are also too low.Read less...

What's a typical passenger rating for Uber? Is 4.50 good?,"ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLC",ippei1202Ube,What'satypic,"Depends on location. Also depends on UberX or UberBlack.The average passenger ratings are different from city to city.  With that said, most drivers feel the average passenger rating is about 4.6. Perhaps we will venture a guess with this scale:Around 4.70~4.90 is good.Between 4.50~4.60 is acceptableBelow 4.50 requires some caution.We have heard from drivers that they do not pick up passengers below 4.80 when it's busy or at airports where, once you are at the top of the queue, a request is guranteed. Furthermore, there seems to be a wide consensus among drivers that they won't pick up anyone below 4.50.For drivers, they average 4.7~4.80, and if they are 4.60 or below, they are in risk of being deactivated.  You rarely see above 4.90, unless you are in smaller cities.Any comments from the drivers?(UPDATE 2018/10/15: Adjusted the scale slightly and inserted a blurb on what ratings drivers would consider declining the requests.)ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Oct 15, 2018"

But please, wait until you're really READY to depart before requesting a driver and have your shoes on and be ready to go when we arrive.  Remember, WE MAKE NOTHING waiting for you, or driving to pick you up.  NOTHING!!!  So please be considerate!!!12.  Lastly, please don't eat Taco's and messy foods in the car.  I know you think you're starving and that drive through Taco Bell stop smells SO good.  But please - it is totally wrong to expect us to stop and clean our car in preparation for the next passenger (who is probably already waiting for us to arrive) to clean up YOUR mess.  That will ALWAYS result in a lower rating.13.  Lastly, be considerate.  Leave the car in better shape than when you arrived.  We are NOT responsbile for your trash, your chewing gum wrappers, your candy papers, and I can ASSURE you the next passenger doesn't want to see them.Read less..."

But you can bring the points up by tipping driver's in cash for several rides until your score goes up. This is just a quick tip to get the ratings up, as by tipping in cash automatically gets you 5 stars, since driver will have no doubt whether you will or will not tip (through the app) = remove all doubt.

I usually work in a tiny town but have worked in the biggest cities many times. There are good and bad people everywhere but 99% of the time people are GREAT to me. I have over 5000 trips with Uber and my rating is usually between 4.95 and 5.00. Right now it is 5.00 and I would like to keep it there unless it means not telling the truth about Ex-President Trump or anything else Conservative News lies about. I get mostly people that agree with me but occasionally not, that is why I received my last three one-star ratings. Fortunately, they have now fallen off and I am back to 5.00! That being said, I believe honesty is more important  than a few one star ratings. I must say also, I am NICE to everyone, regardless if they agree or disagree with me. Have A Great Day!Read less..."

You arrive at destination driver swipes end trip & wants to move on but the rating pops up & we cant get go any further in the app until we rate. If they ard busy and trying to rush maybe they accidentally hit 1 stat or 3 stars instead of 5. Uber WILL NOT change a rating no matter what you tell them for driver or rider. Maybe driver hates rating system so he just clicks whatever to get passed that screen. Not saying its fair but maybe these are reasons. Lyft gives driver 24 hrs to rate rider. Uber gives 5 secs.  Rider gets 2/3 weeks on Uber and not sure on Lyft but its at least 24hrs.Here is another senario. I am not being sarcastic or rude but here is a possibility your rating is not 5 stars. You state "" I am tired, work hard, long hrs, you TRY to be FRIENDLY companion if I MUST"".  ""Really would like to rest, catch up on work, but long ago I  REALIZED they WONT let me I listen and reply in as FRIENDLY WAY AS I CAN"".   I get it yes sometimes its nice to have a conversation with your rider but you worked your long day you are tired you may want peace and quiet. Totally understandable. I cant agree more after you worked all day who wants to hear other peoples problems. I totally agree i would do the same be nice, listen, agree (no driver should be sharing their problems, difficulties, or issues with you, they should keep conversation light, upbeat, and positive). Common sense to most but not all. I capitalized negatives to point out that you MAY enter car with a negative vibe because it seems you get those drivers that unload their problems on you. Its just going to be one of those rides you dread. You are kind enough to listen, show compassion, and try to be friendly. But in reality you want peace and quiet and to be left alone.  That is your right and no one should tell you your rude. It could be possible tbat a few drivers are picking up that you are just going along & being nice because you have to.  Even though you think & feel you are handling these types of drivers wonderfully they may see through it. They also may feel it is fake and your just being condescending. When in fact you feel you are being nice, polite, and friendly. Again not saying you are fake, not saying you should have to change or talk to driver the whole ride. If I have a bad rider and immediately pick another rider up I may smile, i may talk, i may say all the right things but there are times i can feel some awkwardness, negativity in the car becausd of previous rider. Once I realize this I have to let go of the negativity and the anger from previous rider or this will continue after each and every rider. Some people are more sensitive than others and can feel negative energy, vibes, presence, auora whatever you want to call it. Agsin not trying to be rude.Try this next time. Get in the car smile, say good morning, how are you. Driver says my back is killing me, Uber dont listen to its dtivers, my husband is  lazy blah blah blah. Respond with sorry i hope things get better for you I had a rough day also i had to bring my work home with  me so if you will excuse me I have emails i have to answer, vm to listen to, texts to get out or I may just nod off for an hour. At end of ride simply say thank you for giving me quiet time I accomplished a lot or the nap really helped. That should shut that type of driver down and now you can do whatever and not have deal with that type of driver shut it down from beginning. If uncomfortable text driver "" good morning i have a ton of work to catch up on or need a nap i would appreciate the quiet  time. These 2 things can prevent you from having to fake wanting to talk or listen to their problems  sorry couldnt think of another way to phrase it:)  See if it helps it cant hurt. Headphones are great. Get in and say i had a rough day going to stick headphones on and take a nsp or relax. Driver knows you are occupied and comfortable they can concentrate on the roadI think their should be icons you can click ahead of time if you want ex.

Drivers are independent contractors, think of us like plumbers. If  I fixed your faucet one time and you were rude, next time you called me I would not service you (despite your offer to pay me).Drivers are not signing up to drive to drive rude passengers either, but often we are indeed doing just that.

Some people have a different idea of what it takes to close a door. It's fine. Maybe they are used to a heavier door. It's ok, my car can take it and I do not take any offense, they are just closing. the. door. It comes with the territory. If car doors were not designed to handle being closed we'd have a lot of broken car doors... But, I am not surprised some drivers get upset over it. Some people just look for things to get upset over, and after a long day of shuttling people around town sometimes nerves can be frayed...Yeah the short rides thing can be annoying, but it's our job.

I always rating those kind of the nice humble riders 5 stars if they are friendly and socialize with a sense of hummer  by joking and  having a small chatting with the riders trying not ignoring them if they want to talk which make me fill having good time doing my job keeping entertained getting treated as a spacial super star which make me so excited and also keeping our vehicle clean with no mess or damages  or eating and drinking inside making a mess  .if the riders do not engage in conversations I will down rate them with 2 to 3 stars maximum for being formal ,rude and jerks with arrogant behavior acting like they are bossy treating the drivers as a slave especially if they jumped to my car asking me to take them to their destination  without saying ""Hello"" and also if they are not talkative being so quite during the trip entertaining themselves by  texting or talking on the cell or people and also if they are talking among to each other with people inside my car ignoring me instead of chatting with me which is really awkward and super rude ,getting frustrating and makes me feel like a machine doing my job which not nice at all to be rude and disrespectful with no reason and make me feel uncomfortable  .Those kind of riders need to understand Uber is a community service not like a taxi cab service taking them from point A to B  making a space between the riders and drivers.Also it's very annoying ,super awkward and very rude for being quite not chatty or chatting among to each other keep the driver ignored and also when they ask the driver turning on the radio very loud beside ignoring the drivers chatting among to each other so that they deserve 2 stars for misbehave with no respect for the friendly Uber drivers and their vehicle . So if the riders want to be a good 5 star rating passenger they need to make that "" Don't Ignore your friendly Uber driver "". If the riders are looking for a quite service with a quite formal driver without being sociable and friendly avoiding getting a bad star rating for being formal with a drivers all the time during the trip taking them only from point A to point B just to have a relaxation doing their own privacy by making a space or a wall between the drivers not communicating with them without a friendly atmosphere such as : listening to the music or playing a video on the cell phone and also texting or talking on the phone without an excuse or doing their own entertainment by chatting among to each other ....etc ,it's much better to take a public transport up such as a taxi cab , shuttle , bus or luminous with those formal quite drivers . However ;those cab drivers are unfriendly with their passenger , busy and making a space always who are not talkative with there passenger as long they are looking for a quite and relaxation service like that and also they don't have any friendly greeting their riders like us as an Uber's partners.However;If those arrogant riders ignoring us as a friendly drivers like to have a quite ride with your phone texting ,talking and chatting with people with you keeping the uber driver ignored by treating us as a server or slave its will be better for them to take a public transport up such as a taxi cab , shuttle , bus or luminous which is fair enough if they don't show us any friendly treatment with a respect as a human being. That's what riders need with a mutual respect to be nicer and friendly and to treat the driver with courtesy say"" hello,how are you"" . Some of the driver love having a small talk with their riders and many of the drivers don't like a quite riders which make them feel uncomfortable .However; if the rider would like to be chatty with a driver or not It's optional they don't always have to if the rider want a quite ride , but still riders need be more respectful if they don't want to be removing poorly rated passengers drops below 4.0  from the app .Be a good friendly Uber rider with your driver please !!!!!Read less..."

I'm in London where Uber drivers are just regular minicab drivers, many of whom share cars and PCO licences illegally. Now I read that some London drivers are giving all riders 1-star as some misguided protest. I always give drivers 5 stars unless they miss multiple turns, can't communicate basic directions in English, ordrive unsafely. I tip, don't slam doors, don't eat or drink in the car, and I'm always on time to my rides.

Lowest I had ever seen on a great passenger was 4.56. He was from Mexico city and his two friends laughed and laughed when I told him. They (like most passengers) had no idea. Lots of drivers downrate people for reasons other than behavior (race, religion, no tip etc). Whatever, I had an older couple that were 4.3 but a sheduled ride (see airport) so I took it. They were fine, polite, tipped but hsd no idea how to operate the app, or protocol for requsts, where to stand etc. Concierge ordered their ride in advance, some drivers don't like old people or are very impatient.

I've only every had 6 rides, 4 to and from airport, 1 short trip with 6 friends where we split and 1 Saturday night from a club (which was my first). So the 4 airports were from what I remember all pretty easy going, didn't talk with drivers as they didn't want to talk, 2 were from a Gatwick hotel to the airport itself and the other 2 in Basel, we put our own bags in the boot of the car. The late night trip was a 40min cross London trip, we were tired so we weren't loud and we didn't have food with us (pick up was a gay bar, so that may be a factor). Being from the UK and especially not being from London, I tend not to tip, although it seems I really should be, even though it's not in our culture per se, I've worked in the service industry, we don't expect tips here, they are just a bonus if you do. I just wonder if I can ever improve it, I guess with only 6 trips if I pull my finger out and get a few 5 ratings it should improve quickly."

So after 15 of min of no further response after she drove off (had already waited 10 min before she arrived and pulled her ""you're not my fare act) I finally cancelled. I think she pretended I wasn't her fare as she had a very small car and I would have had to put a couple things on her back seat, and in fact she didn't make her claim til I started asking if that was ok.Stupid thing is... the next words out of my mouth would have been ""and I have a towel to put under them to make sure your seat doesn't get dirty"" (not that my bags are dirty, but just in case). And, that's also why I tip well- or at least I thought 45-50% cash tip (with a $5 min) was at least decent, esp considering otherwise I am a model passenger - as I know it takes an extra few minutes to put my stuff in the car and time = $.So wtf am I doing wrong, or could the low rating be just from that one driver? I did report what she did to Uber as that was a lot of bullshit - if she didn't want to drive me she should have cancelled herself, or at least messaged me and pretended she couldn't get to me or some lie that at least would have prevented me from standing there for another 15 min after a 15 hour work day.Btw, I also always give drivers a 5.0 rating, except that one chick. And as I live in a big tourist town and often get off work around 2am, the low rating does hurt me, as there are always a ton of drunk people requesting rides at that hour so I'm sure drivers think the rating means I must be one of them.... when in reality I am anything but! So what exactly is the point of being super considerate and giving good cash tips if I'm not going to be rated accordingly?Read less..."

A week later he claimed we spilled coffee in his car and we were charged a cleaning fee. None of us had any coffee which can be confirmed by concierge at the hotel. The most frustrating thing of all this is just being able to reach Uber easily I guess. I feel like this driver is harassing us even after the ride.

In most states, your friend's name only has to be listed on the vehicle's insurance policy. In some states, especially where the insurance follows the driver (rather than car), Uber seems to require your friend's name to be listed on the registration as well.On a side note: this is a growing problem for the rideshare industry, where Uber drivers either let other people drive to take maximum advantage of the car OR they sign up under one vehicle and drive someone else's cars, etc. a rental.ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Aug 15, 2021"

Even if he is with you, you technically shouldn't be driving!This is due to the insurance that's in play.  While you are delivering food, you would be under Uber's insurance.  If you get into an accident, the insurance company will know who was driving and will likely deny the claim.  What's worse is that your car insurance will likely deny it too, because technically you were working for Uber and Uber should be providing the coverage.  I'd hate for you to be in such a scenario."

No, I am not going to fit 8 people in the back row of my sedan!! I don't care if you can all sit on eachother's laps!
