I have been registered at my previous address and at this address, I have not changed my phone number, I have not changed my name I have not changed any other identifying information and no debt of any sort has ever been communicated to me by either Uber xchange leasing, fair, or Rock Creek capital LLC I was notified by RPM on 11/1/2021 regarding an alleged debt. I have reason to believe I do not owe this debt because I have never been contacted in any form by Rock Creek Capital, LLC; I verified my account in good standing before closing the account is FAIR Leasing; I verified my account in good standing after closing the account is FAIR Leasing, I have never been contacted in any way by FAIR Leasing since closing the account; I verified that I did not infract any clause within the lease agreement before and after returning the vehicle, and I have I had no collections activity reported on any of my credit reports since the account was verified closed in good standing in June 2019. I mailed a demand letter which was received on 11/9/2021 I received a response from RPM dates 11/16/2021, which complies with 15 U.S.C.1692g, and includes the name and address of the original creditor, Rock Creek capital LLC, 4500 Mercantile parkway, suite 300, Forth Worth, Texas 76137) Further, Rock Creek capital LLC (https://www.rockcreekcapitalllc.com/, 888-573-3633 x1 or x2), is not reachable, when you call it goes straight to voicemail and there is not an option for extension one or two. So the debt collection agency, RPM, is attempting to comply with or appear that they are complying with the federal statute, but they are representing a company that has never contacted me, has never appeared on my credit report, and cannot be called, and I have never been informed of any debt with the original Creditor/Leader ""Uber Xchange Leasing"", which was bought by Fair, and Fair is now out of business and unable to be contacted and you can no longer access any of their customer accounts, and I have never been informed of a transfer of debt or an existence of debt with any of the aforementioned companies, except the attempt at collections by RPM. I have records of all the communication, all of the transactions from the original lease, all of the communications between me and the debt collector have been written and recorded. So, I am asking to file this complaint against RPM who I believe is representing either a company or a debt or both falsely, or that they simply do not exist.`"

RPM seems quasi legit: They are registered in my state, but there are plenty of complaints on the web. Neither Uber or Fair ever attempted to contact me regarding this, and I see similar stories on the web (straight to debt collection).  Don't ignore this. You have 30 days to respond, or they get a default judgement. I called them yesterday demanding proof of debt. Waste of time. I got switched to 6 people ad it sounded like a boiler room.

Long story short they sent me a repo letter when I was in contact with them explaining to them that my card was being sent to me because there were issues. I was one week behind with constant communication. Came home one day to a letter in the mail and  texts from a Repo Man. Avis tried getting me for $1,500 for the repo when I return the car the day after I got the repo notice. They are trying to get me for that $1,500 about 18 months later. My bank even verified with Avis that that was paid. These are Uber lease programs are BS"
Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,BellaBlue101,hjhsuac,qksyot,"Maybe you guys can help me but I also am fallen victim to this Debt Collection. I drove for Uber with the Xchange Lease program from 2016-2018. Note: February 2018 Xchange Leasing was sold to Fair. Now I don't know what is going on but I do have all the bank statements after February 2018 showing ALL my payments to Fair. Also, on Uber's website you can download a yearly summary of a certain year and I clicked 2016 and 2017. It shows there that some 5,000 dollars' were taken out of my earnings that year. It clearly says ""Xchange Leasing"" on it. Does any of this proof that I paid on time (including the Bank Statements that shows I paid Fair), does that help my defense in any way?"
Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,AndrewPhilip619,hktcr1d,qksyot,Has anyone actually got a letter back from RPM YET? Some of us got these dreadful letters earlier than others so I’m asking those who submitted their dispute letters weeks ago or sometime in October. I know someone on this Reddit post did and this is what it broke down to: fees and the ending of the lease early. It’s all bull crap because I was never told by Fair that there’s a penalty for this. Original Xchange leasing contract said we can end early but we just won’t get that $250 deductible back. It’s odd. All our credit scores are going to take a hit now. Anyone see any changes on their experian scores yet?
Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,happyprocrastinator,hk0qm3t,hj1f7xi,That letter is unnecessary. All you say on the letter is “I dispute this debt and request validation pursuant to the FDCPA”Checkout a website called creditinfocenter. It teaches you how to beat those corrupt debt collectors.
Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,AndrewPhilip619,hjdirgm,hj1f7xi,"Do you think it’s possible they could mess up our credit? I would’ve think they would’ve done that by now. At least Rock Creek Capital would have showed up in our credit report ages ago. It looks very odd to me. Anyhow I sent my dispute letter and I wonder if this RPM thing is a renegade debt collector that lacks our original contracts from Xchange Leasing, so they can’t go after us unless we admit to the debt by calling them OR we even pay just one dollar of what we owe. Then it’ll show up in the credit monitoring Bureaus"
Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,mot975392,hje2obr,hizwjzr,"He got a postal letter filled with unproven claims from a debt collector.  He wasn't served with a lawsuit.  The letter simply states if the recipient doesn't challenge the validity of the claim(s) in writing then the sender, debt collector, will assume said claims to be valid.  In other words, it's meaningless, full of hot air with no legal teeth behind it."
Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,AndrewPhilip619,hj0lasa,hizwjzr,"I did send a dispute letter saying I don’t believe the debt is mine and to prove it. Also don’t they need contracts from the original creditor? In this case it’s xchange leasing. I spoke to a lawyer, and he said they most likely don’t even have the original contract, so they will not be able to do anything. They will be able to do something if you don’t send them a letter though, and you just ignore it. Also if they try to move forward on this I have proof of paying all leasing fees on time. I have proof of every transaction and I also have proof of the terms of the contract of xchange leasing return terms. In my case I returned the car early, and never on the contract it states that I would penalized with fees if I end the contract early."
Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,AndrewPhilip619,hj6ryam,hj6rirj,I asked for proof of my debt from the original creditor of xchange leasing. I also have every record of me paying the car on time when I had the car. So maybe I have an advantage as I have proof I paid on time. Psychical proof In the forms of bank statements and Uber statements. Did you get the same letter? It seems like all the people who drove for xchange leasing is getting it now.
Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,AndrewPhilip619,hjw7cwc,hjw1qou,"Well if damage was the issue then I guess everyone who got this letter must’ve damaged their car somehow? The car was fine when I turned it in, no damage of any kind. Also I turned the car in more than three years ago. Certainly I would’ve heard of this bill beforehand? It’s puzzling."

Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,SoThenIThought_,hjfi1bb,hjdirgm,"If we do not respond, then it becomes a default judgement and does appear on the credit report.**(Disconnect number one)**Fair is out of business and closed and their customer service line is closed too.**(Disconnected number two)**Yes, a debt this old, for me two years old, should have certainly been in some kind of collections process with Rock Creek capital, unless...**Disconnect number two**: somehow Fair miss-administrated their leases and either/or 1) people who were told that they did not owe money and or that they did not break the terms of their lease were lied to, and/or, 2) Rock Creek capital purchased Fair or any of the Fair accounts and there was some kind of incorrect accounting prior to that transfer so Rock Creek capital believed it was buying that that was collectible, then 3) realized that it likely was not collectible unless they could get a default judgement by the consumer not responding to the debt inquiry, so they hired RPM. Strongest evidence for this is that the debt notice does not contain any fees or interest, which to me looks makes it look like it is not an active debt.**Disconnect number one**: Between when I returned the lease and when Fair went out of business or was sold is an in determined period of time, but I can tell you that I returned the vehicle on June 27, 2019 after its transmission exploded after warranty (warranty was 100,000 miles and the transmission failed at 179,000 miles), and that at that time I specifically reviewed the lease and spoke with Fair multiple times to verify but they still must collect the vehicle and that I am not required to repair the transmission out of warranty. I live in Tacoma and I drove the vehicle in Seattle and I got the vehicle from Jet Chevrolet in Federal Way, WA on December 9th 2016. `How is it possible that during the indeterminate period of time, I was never contacted by Fair when it was still existing as the entity through which I was leasing the vehicle, if there was in fact some kind of a debt?`So other than the two disconnect issues, it seems pretty clear that it is a stab in the dark at a default judgement on a debt that is no longer active or that is assumed to exist only if a default judgment can be granted by the consumer not responding. That's my best guess.Update; Also, turns out RPM has called me several times and my spam filter has caught it every time, but their first call was October 22nd 2021, five days before the mailing of the debt notice."
Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,PatStPete,hj1hbhc,hj0lasa,"Sounds about right. I dealt with Uber and then Fair. I have no idea what happened to Fair after my contract ended. I think that they are throwing shit against the wall, hoping 25% of people won't reply in 30 days. They have nothing to lose. I was actually sad that my contract was up, but I returned it amicably. About the only (small) thing t5hat I didn't like about the contract is that Uber and Fair would not report satisfactory payments to the Credit bureaus. The other oddity is that I still get phone calls from 3rd parties trying to schedule my airbaG-Recall service years after Fair took possession.  Anyways, you are doing fine. I sent my letter today, and the ball is in their court."
Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,mot975392,hje33bn,hj0lasa,"Your lawyer said they, the debt collector, will be able ""to do something"" if you don't reply back within 30 days of their letter?  Other than a lawsuit, what meaningful way can they do?  Answer:  Nothing.If you're worried about your credit report being dinged, then dispute it.  At this point that debt collector will now have to fully expose his hand regarding their claim of you owing them money.  If they do then this will give you an early look into the strength/weakness of their claim in case you go to trial.  BTW, if you're level headed, defending lawsuits from debt collectors isn't too difficult."
Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,Speakerforthepeople,hj6th4u,hj6ryam,"I’m thinking they can’t validate. Iirc, Uber sold off Xleasing to Fair, Fair went under-ish/lost their contract with Uber, so Fair maybe resold the portfolio. From what I’ve heard, often JDBs buy a spreadsheet of names, dates, amounts, maybe a ss# or only last 4, and contact info. Usually no paper trail and no resources to secure documentation. They then send out dunning letters/call/email to collect from those most vulnerable to scare tactics, no proof due to age of debt, or unaware of their rights.You’re a next level record keeper. Respect."
Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,BellaBlue101,hjt59m2,hjsan4q,"We all did pay the lease on time. The issue is that when Xchange Leasing was sold to Fair, something happened there somehow. I have the proof, definitive proof I paid Fair on time on the leasing payments. I have proof that we were allowed to end out contracts early without a penalty to pay out the rest of the loan. I am thinking about contacting a lawyer to work for me in this regard. Unless that too is a bad idea ? I sent the debt collection agency Receivables Payable Management (RPM) a dispute letter and proof of debt. Certified mail. I never called them but I was reading in other places people have tried, and it was a total mess. Can't get to someone who can help you and it sounds like a boiler room over there. Xchange Leasing is listed as the ""original creditor"". Wouldn't RPM need proof of their contract and any contracts from them that I signed? They are completely out of business now, Xchange went under in February 2018. So, good luck if these junk debt buyers also bought the contracts and documents?"

Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,SoThenIThought_,hjhqx3p,hjgokup,"I certainly expected them to start calling once I received the attempted default get judgement letter in the mail, however oh, they are required by law to respond in writing when requested to provide proof of the debt and if requested a copy of their authorization to collect debt in the state of Washington. So they can call me all they want I have nothing to say to them until I get a copy of the actual debt and their authorization to collect it in Washington.If they do not provide a copy of both within 30 days then the debt is not valid. If somehow they do you respond with copies of both then I will contact my State attorney general regarding collection of a debt about which there has never been any correspondence for multiple years, even after the original lender went out of business or was absorbed or purchased. I will follow their guidance with how to dispute the debt with whoever owns the debt currently, which is probably Rock Creek capital. (BTW how is it possible that if the debt is real that it was transferred between companies and I was not notified?)Making minimum arrange payments on a debt before it goes to collections causes it not to appear on a credit report. Essentially, to be frank, a lot of the panic you're feeling is probably just because you need a refresher on how debt collection works and what avenues you have to prevent it from affecting your credit, which is of course, outside the scope of this sub. Certainly there is no real need to contact a credit repair company when they have not even verified that the debt is valid. This is like looking to buy a really fast car, and then picking out a tombstone to use when it kills you, instead of just driving reasonably or being trained. Contacting a debt repair company would be appropriate if you wish to be saddled with a default debt judgment and you wish for it to go to collections and not pay it and then you wish to pay a credit repair company to make payments on your behalf, so that seems like a series of very not ideal circumstances, at least to me.If you were RPM and you were given the contract to call on a bunch of debt for which the owner, Rock Creek capital wanted to get a default judgment and or any money, wouldn't you call excessively in the first 30 days to try to get people to pay it, and then you can collect on the ones that never responded in writing like we did after the 30-day mark because it will be issued as a default judgement. They are counting on people to panic and pay it because they are getting called so much"

Not cool at all that Uber does that.,LalacastSD,hma3h9d,r376w5,"Uber uses surge in many different ways. The one thing you have to remember is that whatever Uber offers you,  it is ALWAYS to the benefit of Uber. The best way to maximize any incentives is to figure out what Uber is gaining first, and then adjust your strategy to make it work for you. Uber's primary goal is the exact opposite of Drivers goal. Uber wants a high driver-idle rate,  which would mean drivers always available. Drivers don't ever want to be idle, that's when we aren't making any money and technically and practically,  we're losing money. So, surge does NOT always mean high demand, at all.  It many times means that Uber`s algorithm is just trying to get more idle drivers in the area in anticipation of demand.  If you drive to the area,  it doesn't matter how high the surge is,  if there's no demand then you don't get it.  Sometimes it is only one passenger,  too,  and someone else got it first,  then there are no more ride requests. Also,  as soon as you go online during that type of surge,  then you are now an idle driver so it changes the surge rate. As soon as you go offline,  they have one less idle driver,  surge rate goes up to try to entice someone else to go online. That's your up- and - down. There are a lot of reasons for the different surges and learning how to recognize them is important,  I'm a 5- year driver but i took 18 months off so I had to re- learn some of these things in the last few months. I spent a long time when I first started driving, trying to figure out the maximum earnings for the minimum expenses for the days and the hours I wanted to work,  everyone's formula or strategy varies based on that and many other factors."

No delayed flights.  San Diego Airport has an arrival curfew or whatever that's called.  I actually laughed when I saw it and I even looked up to see if there was anything coming in.  Nope. A few minutes later,  I saw the surge drop to $14, and now there's a driver in the lot. A few minutes later,  no surge, 5 drivers in the lot. The algorithm probably went off just because it was early Thanksgiving morning and the software ""expected"" more flights,  and airport queues don't like 0 drivers. But I've also been near the airport,  early morning before any arrivals, and received pick up requests that turned out to be employees. However,  I would think employees try to avoid paying a surge.

Currently, aside from a complaint initiated unmatching, which must be done manually, the only other way to be unmatched is to report a rider as not wearing a facemask after the trip, which triggers an automatic unmatching. It's a great way to fuck your rating though, since Uber pax can see what you rated them immediately if it lowers their rating, and they have 24 hours to change their rating of you. Lyft let both pax and driver change ratings or add comments for 24 hours, at which point both go live. This prevents retaliatory rating."

what’s the difference between feedback and report?,meh092613,r38ukx,0,"Uber warned me that I was driving bad apparently by a rider and when I inquired, they told me that it’s just a feedback and it’s not an accusation.So will a feedback get me in trouble or like what? I don’t get itEdit: I just checked, it was my last ride since the payment tab looks as if their payment was refunded. Ratchet people will always be ratchet."
what’s the difference between feedback and report?,DeerParkVegan,hm9591r,r38ukx,Feedback to that customer: you are a hoe
what’s the difference between feedback and report?,meh092613,hm988sh,r38ukx,Also it’s kinda ass how they won’t let me upload the dashcam for the whole thing (it was my last ride).
what’s the difference between feedback and report?,pakrat1967,hm9pojl,r38ukx,Feedback is from rating below 5*.  It's just the extremely limited canned choices that come up.  Any recent feedback should show up just below your ratings.  Again it's just canned responses that may not accurately convey what you did wrong.A report is made when either side goes into the trip history and makes a complaint there.
what’s the difference between feedback and report?,meh092613,hm96956,hm9591r,"Lmao, it’s probably my last passenger tbh or maybe that passenger who told me to wait at the pin and then told me to pick her up 3 blocks away when the 5 minutes passed.I was like “I’m sorry but 5 minutes has passed, I’m gonna cancel.” It’s just weird cause I thought passenger can’t rate or give us feedback when we charge them for not showing up.Edit: it’s my last passenger. He requested a ride for his hoe and was too broke to pay for the whole ride."
what’s the difference between feedback and report?,meh092613,hm9q2ud,hm9pojl,"Yeah I got reported lol, they wanted to refund their $15 trip. Fucking hoodrats can’t even afford a $15 trip.At least Uber was nice enough to tell me that they won’t do anything about it but further reports by other people will get me deactivated which sucks lmaoOh well, if I ever get deactivated, I’ll sue the fuck out of Uber because they won’t even let me show the video for them."

Thanks and have a great night!""And that's how I've gotten $10 (or larger) cash tips about a dozen times on $5ish fares.

How to (sometimes) get a big cash tip,pantene2inone,hm77ymy,r2wv7i,"Here's another way, albeit not cash but...   whenever someone asks to stop at a store,  if they don't ask if I want anything, I ask them to grab me 2 or 3 red bulls, whichever size is on sale. 8oz usually 2/$4 or 3/$5.  Or 12 oz 2/$5.  I dig a 5 out of my pocket as I ask.   Out of the hundreds of times I've done this only 2x have they taken my money.   I drink a few redbulls whenever I'm out driving so to me, this is as good as cash.   If I drive regularly I almost never pay for them.   I go home some nights with 4-8 cans.   Try it with your preferred energy drink next time..."

Grocery getters,iWoodcutter,r3282x,0,"When picking up a pax at a grocery store, should driver start the ride and then assist with loading or wait to start when pax is seated and ready to roll?  I am guessing pax could get dinged for unnecessary waiting charges depending on the clock?  Once you start loading, you are committed to the ride - so what are the pros and cons?"
Grocery getters,Wildberryboy,hm82huf,r3282x,I never assist with loading unless you're elderly.   That's too extra
Grocery getters,pakrat1967,hm86y15,r3282x,"I wait till they load up, get in and have their mask on.  Don't wanna go through the hassle of ending the trip at pickup if they don't have a mask.  I don't end the trip until they completely unload everything and close the trunk.  I never help load or unload.  Sometimes at airport pickups.  I'll get out and offer to help with luggage and open the doors for them.  But they are on their own at the drop off.We are not chauffeurs, nor are we their servants.  And yes I get tipped frequently.  Both in the app and cash."
Grocery getters,peteaw,hm82gpx,r3282x,I just start it when they come to the car and start loading.

Also to speed them up unloading groceries ""So just to let you guys know uber charges a higher fee to wait once at the destination, so you may want to unload your groceries on the sidewalk and make your trips back and forth from there"" I only say this at apartments,  I hate waiting for them to make multiple trips from my trunk to there 6 storey apartment. I live in an area where this happens a few times a day to me. If they have any problem ""uber offers grocery delivery threw the Ubereats, to tell you the truth its easier and cheaper then ubering back and forth from the store, and they even deliver the groceries to your front door.

Grocery getters,keista69,hm84g25,r3282x,"I used to start the second the first bag gets placed in the car.  Now I wait until the pax is masked and in my car.  If they refuse the mask, they get to unload everything because they won't ride in my car without a mask.  Hasn't happened yet."

"Bleh, parking tickets.",ACriticalGeek,r369s5,0,"Parking Tickets just came in the mail from stopping where the app sent us to stop on Lafeyette taking people to the Niner game. Cop was actually taking up one of the two drop off spots, and I had successfully stopped and dropped off in the other one. Of course my dash cam footage has erased by now. Other ticket is legit I guess, since I didn’t wait to drop off in the one spot left by the cop, that he was writing tickets for anyway, apparently.Yeah so, Sunday, drop off at the drop off spot on Great America Parkway, just north of the Great America park entrance stoplight. Lafayette (where the app sends you to the Amtrak drop off) will get you tickets, 53 bucks a pop.Edit: and Learn to use Lafayette to get to Red Lot 7 for post game pickups."

"Bleh, parking tickets.",ACriticalGeek,hma082s,hm9w7gh,"Opened my mailbox, ticket slips were in an envelope. :)In California, cops only need to record the license plate of tcn cars to issue tickets to the registered owner. They don’t even need to make you aware you are being ticketed if you are wearing the tags.You know, because we’re supposed to know that stuff. Makes it harder to contest."
"Bleh, parking tickets.",Morhadel,hma1mwm,hma082s,"What's TNC? Is that a typo. Shouldn't that make it easier to contest. Under the Sixth Amendment you have a right to face your accuser if they can't identify you the citation should be thrown out. In North Carolina the only tickets you can be given without the officer giving them face to face are the traffic cam violations. But you get around those by sending in a letter stating that you weren't driving, and then you state how many people legally have access to your vehicle. As long as they don't have a picture of your face which in North Carolina your tag is in the rear so all the photos are in the back of the vehicle. I've gotten out of every traffic cam violation. Thanks but you just gave me another reason why I'm never going to live in California oh, excuse me, Commiforniastan"

Lyft has a quest like bonus this weekend, so I’ll drive for them (barf) hoping enough drivers do. So why is it like this? Because this time of year more people drive to cover Christmas expenses, there’s usually an over abundance of drivers - sometimes it’s quite extreme. So expect it to be fairly slow."

No quests this weekend,pdxfotoguy,hm6z0ln,hm6yqzs,"Annnd just looked at the Uber pax app and there’s 4 cars available in the entire city lol. Really hope this means there will be a weekday quest on Monday. I can’t drive without a bonus, gas is too expensive."

No quests this weekend,beersticker,hm6ojp1,hm67g8z,I was searching google to find out and here’s my answer. Maybe I’ll do Lyft this weekend instead since Uber isn’t giving out our quests.

No quests this weekend,Nythain,hm6n4yp,hm6m7ri,"Well, hopefully you can hang in there as new drivers burn out or realize it's not worth it and move on to something else. My market, KC, isn't hurting so bad with on the busy factor, though it has slowed a little presumably a combination of increase in drivers and cold weather setting in."
No quests this weekend,irishthumper66,hm8ghuu,hm6m7ri,"Re: airport You're setting the effect of the teachers and the goofballs who think uber is a magical money bucket they can tap into any time they need $100... so they'll saturate the airports because they think rides are easier... ask the while, they piss off most Pax because these drivers don't take driving serious so it effects drivers who drive full time... half the stories from airport Pax are about the LAST Uber driver and the nightmare ride..."
No quests this weekend,versacesquatch,hm6599n,hm645dc,Right. So show uber that with your actions this weekend
No quests this weekend,keista69,hm88irr,hm88484,In a market that had no quests until this past spring.

ACH transfer mistake,PaleontologistOne394,r2ry4o,0,"I signed up to receive an ACH transfer from Uber. I accumulated ~$3,650.00 in earnings owed to me.I miss entered my bank account information. The last two digits were switched around. Uber has confirmed that the transfer went through. It obviously did not hit my bank account. My Bank is asking UBER to confirm the account it was transferred to so they can take the funds back and transfer to me.Uber has done zero to help me out. All they can say is the funds were transferred successfully.  With a trace ID number, which they bank says they can’t use. What are my options here? Any suggestions?"
ACH transfer mistake,Accomplished-Home471,hm6cq7p,r2ry4o,"Call and call and call until you find someone at Uber that can help you..  there’s always one person that’s willing to go above and beyond the script, you just gotta find that one person. Good luck 🙏 hope it gets resolved soon."
ACH transfer mistake,frapawhack,hm6emwy,r2ry4o,Try twitter. worked for me
ACH transfer mistake,pakrat1967,hm6klbf,r2ry4o,"Did Uber stop verifying payout accounts?  When I signed up in 2018, they did a 2¢ deposit/withdrawal where I had to confirm that the transactions went through."
ACH transfer mistake,dabva,hm6rdgk,r2ry4o,"There might be a support option for exactly this situation, is that what you did?wallet -> balance -> find the weekly payout -> get help -> my direct deposit is late or missing -> answer ""is your checking account info on your bank account correct"""
ACH transfer mistake,pogiguy2020,hm72tst,r2ry4o,"Imagine someone with that account number seeing that deposit and thinking they got another Government stimulus check. Hopefully they can correct this, but like most things it takes much longer to FIX it then it does to TAKE it."
ACH transfer mistake,xlr8edm0m3ntum,hm87xhp,r2ry4o,"Any bank can use a trace id (through the ACH process most use Fiserv). However, front line representatives that you speak to will not generally have this knowledge (depending on the bank). You need to escalate the call to their escalations team / payment research team, or just ask for higher up (usually it's not a ""manager"" but an escalation team)."
ACH transfer mistake,xlr8edm0m3ntum,hm88cxq,hm6cq7p,^ the issue with this is once the money leaves uber they generally have no control over it after
ACH transfer mistake,xlr8edm0m3ntum,hm88a6z,hm6emwy,"^ this has some potential (depending on the bank) as their social media team usually has higher connections to teams that can locate the ""missing payment"" with the trace#"
ACH transfer mistake,PaleontologistOne394,hm6my43,hm6klbf,Yep. They did not do that
ACH transfer mistake,Fearless_Climate4612,hm6xcdu,hm6klbf,"Did the same for me in 2017. Damn, that would suck."
ACH transfer mistake,xlr8edm0m3ntum,hm882tf,hm6rdgk,^ the issue with this is once the money leaves uber they generally have no control over it after
ACH transfer mistake,xlr8edm0m3ntum,hm88561,hm72tst,Might have just been stuck in the general ledger tbh
Nexar Dashcam,Kal_El1984,r35vp7,0,"Has anyone signed up for the nexar dashcam in the Uber app? If so, what’s your experience like?"
Nexar Dashcam,kai54321,hm8z9v9,r35vp7,Basically. Just a note under Uber account.   Both you and passengers are able to see it. That’s it.  Nothing else.
Nexar Dashcam,Nythain,hma4iq8,hm8z9v9,"Thank you. I've tried explaining this a few times now but everyone is ""oh noes, Ubers gonna spy on me and deactivate me for picking my nose!"""
