I have been registered at my previous address and at this address, I have not changed my phone number, I have not changed my name I have not changed any other identifying information and no debt of any sort has ever been communicated to me by either Uber xchange leasing, fair, or Rock Creek capital LLC I was notified by RPM on 11/1/2021 regarding an alleged debt. I have reason to believe I do not owe this debt because I have never been contacted in any form by Rock Creek Capital, LLC; I verified my account in good standing before closing the account is FAIR Leasing; I verified my account in good standing after closing the account is FAIR Leasing, I have never been contacted in any way by FAIR Leasing since closing the account; I verified that I did not infract any clause within the lease agreement before and after returning the vehicle, and I have I had no collections activity reported on any of my credit reports since the account was verified closed in good standing in June 2019. I mailed a demand letter which was received on 11/9/2021 I received a response from RPM dates 11/16/2021, which complies with 15 U.S.C.1692g, and includes the name and address of the original creditor, Rock Creek capital LLC, 4500 Mercantile parkway, suite 300, Forth Worth, Texas 76137) Further, Rock Creek capital LLC (https://www.rockcreekcapitalllc.com/, 888-573-3633 x1 or x2), is not reachable, when you call it goes straight to voicemail and there is not an option for extension one or two. So the debt collection agency, RPM, is attempting to comply with or appear that they are complying with the federal statute, but they are representing a company that has never contacted me, has never appeared on my credit report, and cannot be called, and I have never been informed of any debt with the original Creditor/Leader ""Uber Xchange Leasing"", which was bought by Fair, and Fair is now out of business and unable to be contacted and you can no longer access any of their customer accounts, and I have never been informed of a transfer of debt or an existence of debt with any of the aforementioned companies, except the attempt at collections by RPM. I have records of all the communication, all of the transactions from the original lease, all of the communications between me and the debt collector have been written and recorded. So, I am asking to file this complaint against RPM who I believe is representing either a company or a debt or both falsely, or that they simply do not exist.`Edit: Added: 11/29: on 11/18 submitted a complaint to the state's attorney general office, submitted a complaint against Rock Creek capital and RPM to cfpbhttps://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/- on 11/29 submitted a second complaint to cfpb about RPM and fair, whose full name is Fair Financial Corphttps://labusinessjournal.com/news/2021/oct/04/fair-car-leasing-app-relaunch/- on 11/29: copy and pasted the complaint to cfpb into a complaint to BBB for RPM"

I drove for Uber with the Xchange Lease program from 2016-2018. Note: February 2018 Xchange Leasing was sold to Fair. Now I don't know what is going on but I do have all the bank statements after February 2018 showing ALL my payments to Fair. Also, on Uber's website you can download a yearly summary of a certain year and I clicked 2016 and 2017. It shows there that some 5,000 dollars' were taken out of my earnings that year. It clearly says ""Xchange Leasing"" on it. Does any of this proof that I paid on time (including the Bank Statements that shows I paid Fair), does that help my defense in any way?"
Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,AndrewPhilip619,hktcr1d,qksyot,Has anyone actually got a letter back from RPM YET? Some of us got these dreadful letters earlier than others so I’m asking those who submitted their dispute letters weeks ago or sometime in October. I know someone on this Reddit post did and this is what it broke down to: fees and the ending of the lease early. It’s all bull crap because I was never told by Fair that there’s a penalty for this. Original Xchange leasing contract said we can end early but we just won’t get that $250 deductible back. It’s odd. All our credit scores are going to take a hit now. Anyone see any changes on their experian scores yet?
Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,AndrewPhilip619,hn8ruhq,qksyot,"MASSIVE UPDATE: I used a website called CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) to complain to RPM that this isn’t my debt. So I did send a dispute letter but at the same time, shortly after I did that I went on the website to complain about the situation at hand. 15 days later, RPM responded. RPM’s response basically said I don’t owe any of the debt and that Rock Creek Capital $0’d my account and that all attempts to collect this debt willBe ceased. So point being, complain on the CFPB. It works and it’ll get you off the hook if RPM is still hounding you over this debt."

At least Rock Creek Capital would have showed up in our credit report ages ago. It looks very odd to me. Anyhow I sent my dispute letter and I wonder if this RPM thing is a renegade debt collector that lacks our original contracts from Xchange Leasing, so they can’t go after us unless we admit to the debt by calling them OR we even pay just one dollar of what we owe.

Also don’t they need contracts from the original creditor? In this case it’s xchange leasing. I spoke to a lawyer, and he said they most likely don’t even have the original contract, so they will not be able to do anything. They will be able to do something if you don’t send them a letter though, and you just ignore it. Also if they try to move forward on this I have proof of paying all leasing fees on time. I have proof of every transaction and I also have proof of the terms of the contract of xchange leasing return terms.

Strongest evidence for this is that the debt notice does not contain any fees or interest, which to me looks makes it look like it is not an active debt.**Disconnect number one**: Between when I returned the lease and when Fair went out of business or was sold is an in determined period of time, but I can tell you that I returned the vehicle on June 27, 2019 after its transmission exploded after warranty (warranty was 100,000 miles and the transmission failed at 179,000 miles), and that at that time I specifically reviewed the lease and spoke with Fair multiple times to verify but they still must collect the vehicle and that I am not required to repair the transmission out of warranty. I live in Tacoma and I drove the vehicle in Seattle and I got the vehicle from Jet Chevrolet in Federal Way, WA on December 9th 2016. `How is it possible that during the indeterminate period of time, I was never contacted by Fair when it was still existing as the entity through which I was leasing the vehicle, if there was in fact some kind of a debt?`So other than the two disconnect issues, it seems pretty clear that it is a stab in the dark at a default judgement on a debt that is no longer active or that is assumed to exist only if a default judgment can be granted by the consumer not responding. That's my best guess.Update; Also, turns out RPM has called me several times and my spam filter has caught it every time, but their first call was October 22nd 2021, five days before the mailing of the debt notice."
Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,Speakerforthepeople,hj6th4u,hj6ryam,"I’m thinking they can’t validate. Iirc, Uber sold off Xleasing to Fair, Fair went under-ish/lost their contract with Uber, so Fair maybe resold the portfolio. From what I’ve heard, often JDBs buy a spreadsheet of names, dates, amounts, maybe a ss# or only last 4, and contact info. Usually no paper trail and no resources to secure documentation. They then send out dunning letters/call/email to collect from those most vulnerable to scare tactics, no proof due to age of debt, or unaware of their rights.You’re a next level record keeper.

Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,PatStPete,hj1hbhc,hj0lasa,"Sounds about right. I dealt with Uber and then Fair. I have no idea what happened to Fair after my contract ended. I think that they are throwing shit against the wall, hoping 25% of people won't reply in 30 days. They have nothing to lose. I was actually sad that my contract was up, but I returned it amicably. About the only (small) thing t5hat I didn't like about the contract is that Uber and Fair would not report satisfactory payments to the Credit bureaus. The other oddity is that I still get phone calls from 3rd parties trying to schedule my airbaG-Recall service years after Fair took possession.  Anyways, you are doing fine. I sent my letter today, and the ball is in their court."

Other than a lawsuit, what meaningful way can they do?  Answer:  Nothing.If you're worried about your credit report being dinged, then dispute it.  At this point that debt collector will now have to fully expose his hand regarding their claim of you owing them money.  If they do then this will give you an early look into the strength/weakness of their claim in case you go to trial.  BTW, if you're level headed, defending lawsuits from debt collectors isn't too difficult."
Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,BellaBlue101,hjt59m2,hjsan4q,"We all did pay the lease on time. The issue is that when Xchange Leasing was sold to Fair, something happened there somehow.

I am thinking about contacting a lawyer to work for me in this regard. Unless that too is a bad idea ? I sent the debt collection agency Receivables Payable Management (RPM) a dispute letter and proof of debt. Certified mail. I never called them but I was reading in other places people have tried, and it was a total mess. Can't get to someone who can help you and it sounds like a boiler room over there.

Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,SoThenIThought_,hjhqx3p,hjgokup,"I certainly expected them to start calling once I received the attempted default get judgement letter in the mail, however oh, they are required by law to respond in writing when requested to provide proof of the debt and if requested a copy of their authorization to collect debt in the state of Washington. So they can call me all they want I have nothing to say to them until I get a copy of the actual debt and their authorization to collect it in Washington.If they do not provide a copy of both within 30 days then the debt is not valid. If somehow they do you respond with copies of both then I will contact my State attorney general regarding collection of a debt about which there has never been any correspondence for multiple years, even after the original lender went out of business or was absorbed or purchased. I will follow their guidance with how to dispute the debt with whoever owns the debt currently, which is probably Rock Creek capital. (BTW how is it possible that if the debt is real that it was transferred between companies and I was not notified?)Making minimum arrange payments on a debt before it goes to collections causes it not to appear on a credit report. Essentially, to be frank, a lot of the panic you're feeling is probably just because you need a refresher on how debt collection works and what avenues you have to prevent it from affecting your credit, which is of course, outside the scope of this sub. Certainly there is no real need to contact a credit repair company when they have not even verified that the debt is valid. This is like looking to buy a really fast car, and then picking out a tombstone to use when it kills you, instead of just driving reasonably or being trained. Contacting a debt repair company would be appropriate if you wish to be saddled with a default debt judgment and you wish for it to go to collections and not pay it and then you wish to pay a credit repair company to make payments on your behalf, so that seems like a series of very not ideal circumstances, at least to me.If you were RPM and you were given the contract to call on a bunch of debt for which the owner, Rock Creek capital wanted to get a default judgment and or any money, wouldn't you call excessively in the first 30 days to try to get people to pay it, and then you can collect on the ones that never responded in writing like we did after the 30-day mark because it will be issued as a default judgement. They are counting on people to panic and pay it because they are getting called so much"

Debt collection for Xchange Leasing?,redwolff11,hmrj89q,hjgokup,One easy thing you can do. Is something I have done.  Monitor credit reports.  Dispute EVERYTHING. you can do this online.  They have a relatively short time to respond. If they don’t the debt must be cleared.  Also 7 years is the limit things can stay on your credit reports.  Many will try to keep things there longer.  And creditors are also swamped right now and may not be able to respond to a dispute in time.  I also got a secured credit card and paid it religiously and only used small amounts at a time.  This helps fast.  Good luck.  Hope something here helps. Also student loans are not covered here unfortunately

What the hell is destination mode good for?,FlashyCow1,hnq3lup,rbsg4h,If you want add arrival time. Destination mode without that is just meant to get you five minutes closer from any direction and not always on your general route. It can as you found out still add a lot of miles onto the route. For instance let's say I do Airport as the destination without arrival time. The drive will take 30 minutes without rides. My next ride is going past the Airport by about 25 minutes. Next one adds to que and is 20 minutes away from the Airport on east side. Then third is 15 minutes away on west side. Then next one is back halfway to where first ride was and is 10 minutes away. Now you may get a ride going there. That does happen. Arrival time will be more likely to keep on your route.

They don’t: 1. Allow guests to leave reviews2. Take false reports about my drivers3. Threaten my business 4. Threaten to deactivate me, my business or drivers5. Take 56-70% of each fare6.

Amazon uses star ratings, Uber uses star ratings, so they must be a technology company.  Not so fast.Like most good things, Uber uses the public perception of a good thing for its advantage.  ""bad"" drivers with low stars get booted.  Driver Stars are use as a stick for carrots such as Super Duper Double Blue driver status.  I remember when I started Uber would use the star system as a carrot to have drivers provide water and snacks for paxs.  ""Drivers with higher ratings provide water, snacks, chargers, for their customers, blah blah.""If you are a driver and don't like to take low rated paxs but are afraid to NOT take a ride b/c you are on a series promo, don't be.  Accept that 4.2 rated passenger and then cancel the trip as ""Pick-Up Unsafe"".  When you chose ""Pick-up Unsafe"" as the driver cancellation reason, it does not break a series promotion.And before I get off my soap box ... The only advantage I find to the star system is it is a secret way for drivers to identify bad rides.  The passenger may be great, or not, but there is something ""bad"" about the ride.  Could be a pick-up spot with no parking, could be a long trip to the boonies, could be a passenger who likes to be dropped off on the 7th floor of an apartment building parking garage, whatever.  Below 4.7 is where I start to think, maybe I should avoid the hassle and cancel as ""pick-up unsafe""."

The one they didn’t was 3 business project workers that I picked up at the airport.  I drove them for 50 minutes and was expecting a tip. Then they got out without saying anything to me (very odd) they were chatting to each other and the ride seemed fine.  It was literally the first time I was never even acknowledged when a rider or riders exited my car. Made me feel worthless. And I drove so fkn good and was very friendly.

File on Uber for returned item fee and just say you returned it to the police station per his instructions, and provide your paperwork or whatever. He will get billed and you will get paid atleast $15, maybe more. And, as a bonus, it will be an administrative headache for him to get the wallet from them.

Should I switch to driving for Uber so late in the year?,SolarisGaudium,rbn5or,0,"Hello! I tried searching through the reddit and couldn't find the info I needed, so I apologize if I'm just blind and this has been asked before.Right now I work for Door dash, and while I don't hate it right now, I'm starting to get frustrated. I was thinking of switching to Uber instead, since I miss driving passengers (I'm a tour bus driver but that doesn't start until March) but with it so close to the end of the year, I have no idea if it would be worth the headache taxes could end up being. I haven't even filed taxes for Door dash before, so I'm still unsure of what I'm doing lol.Anyways, do you guys think it's worth switching over to Uber, or is it not worth it pay wise? Has anyone done that before that could give me some tips? I live in a tourist town even in the winter, so I'm thinking I might get a similar amount of work, but idk for sure.Thanks in advance!"

I don't remember but a trunk of your money may be taxed next year. So this year you may not be required to report the Uber income. You do require but Uber may not need to submit anything to the IRS.There's not much to do in filing other than logging your mileages. Tax software will make it easier. Though you have to follow the tax summary Uber gives you, reporting a lot more earnings than they pay you and also a lot more fees."

My Uber driver went above and beyond,trontrontronmega,rbdlky,0,"I still am so happy and wanted to express my gratitude more than just to him. I left an item in his car, he found it the next day.  It wasn’t an expensive item just something that is a super hassle to replace. He contacted me and let me know and I suggested I would come to him (he lived about an hour away) or I would send him a label to post it to me.He suggested next time he was in my area he would call me and I could meet him. He text me yesterday and said he was in my area though it was a good half an hour away. He offered to come to me and drop it off, which he did. He refused any payment I tried to offer and was just super happy to hand it back. I went on my past rides and left him an extra tip as a way to pay him but the fact that he refused it originally was super generous and kind and he really didn’t need to do that.The funny thing was last night I was in a Uber and I found someone’s phone there and handed it to the Uber driver and told him my story on how the other driver helped me and he said he would make sure he did the same with this phone (as in don’t keep it tell him you have it)  which I know the owner of the phone was probably worried about not getting it back. Anyway just wanted to give my experience and how grateful I am. Saved me a lot of hassle! But want to add even if he hadnt dropped it off - I was just so happy he had it. I was willing to go hour away to get it worse case. Third time Uber driver has located something ive lost which keeps me loving Uber’s."

Flat surge and multiply.,FgtPwr,rbavvi,0,How do you tell I’d the surge is a flat amount or it multiplies based on t he distance?  I get both but seems random.
Flat surge and multiply.,Accomplished-Home471,hnnf1l7,rbavvi,It all depends how much Uber profits from the ride.  Sticky surge is the minimum you’ll get.
Flat surge and multiply.,FgtPwr,hnnfyyi,hnnf1l7,Are all surge sticky?  If not how do you tell?
Flat surge and multiply.,Accomplished-Home471,hnnhce9,hnnfyyi,You don’t tell. It all depends how much the person paid for the ride. The surge you see when the request pops up is the minimum you get.
Flat surge and multiply.,StrangFrut,hnnroz4,hnnfyyi,"yes, they're all sticky. Sticky just refers to, as opposed to the past, the fact that when u drive into a surge, that amount sticks to u & is good for yr next ride. Before u just got whatever was on the rider's request area when they requested.If the surge is $4 u get $4 added to yr next ride. But if it's a longer ride, & if the rider paid ""significantly more"" according to Uber (u can read info on this stuff from Uber), they add some ""additional surge amount"". At no point do u get a mulitiplier tho. They just add more. If u get a rider who wasn't paying surge tho, u get no extra. U just get the $4. U can't tell the difference unless u go to the rider app, put a pin on the spot they're at, & see if it's charging more than it normally would. How do u know what is normal? U havta know their destination. Use google maps to see the route. Look at the rider pay rates & see what the ride would normally cost, then compare it to what it's charging. Not practical, but that's how u know. & even then, u don't knw for sure.Flat surge was implemented to allow Uber to charge riders more & pay drivers less. Tho they announced it by saying ""we listened to drivers & drivers don't like when the surge disappears before they get there, so now if u get to the surge u get to keep it""."

Throttling trips?,Mighty2293,rbfpr5,0,Does Uber throttle trips when you’re on X amount of ride quests? Sitting in Tempe/Scottsdale AZ at 7pm and I’m getting less than 2 rides/hour average today. Including getting rides that are 5 minutes total from accept to drop off but then there’s just nothing for 30+ minutes when the place is packed full of people eating at bars and walking around etc. I’ve never had this issue until taking a 60+20 trip quest. Thoughts?
Throttling trips?,WeirdPie69,hno481h,rbfpr5,"Its just been a recent issue, Ive noticed a decent amount of decreased ride requests in my normal busy areas as well. Another post on this reddit thread was talking about the Great Resignation influencing more people to be drivers, creating less demand per driver"
Throttling trips?,exponentialrise,hno7qdw,rbfpr5,In Scottsdale now and no ride requests are coming in. I've been online for 3 hours and done 5 short rides. $26.43. No tips. Going for $170 for 20 ride quest but it seems like even that won't make this worthwhile. Might have to throw in the towel for this week with Uber again. Absolute trash. I have no clue what drivers are talking about when they say Uber is better than Lyft.
Throttling trips?,No_Plantain_1132,hnoebmk,rbfpr5,"You should expect that, given the size of the quests this week, there are just more drivers out going for it. It's unethical for them to do it, because there will be many who cannot make the one they chose."

Throttling trips?,Mighty2293,hnopjrj,hno7qdw,How’s your experience been with Lyft? Do you get promos or quests etc like Uber? I see a lot of Lyft stickers at the airport but majority are Uber or Uber black/black suv of course
Throttling trips?,philfl,hnoqvno,hnoebmk,"\^ THIS \^In my account, I've seen the week / weekend quest bonuses increase, but at the expense of taking away the Consecutive Trip Bonuses (2 fer $14.50, etc.), plus seeing way fewer surge opportunities.This is being done on purpose as Uber knows that without CTBs and Surge, the lure of larger quests will be what it takes to still get drivers on the road. The problem is that in order to hit your 50, 60, 70, 80 rides, the closer you get, the more control Uber exerts on your week / weekend because you've passed your own personal point of no return. You need those rides or all your efforts are in vain...Uber knows this and has you by the balls. At least with CTBs and Surge, you can work 5 hours, 10 hours, 15 hours at key times in key places and make whatever one deems reasonable and choose when to stop for the week.Make no mistake...this current setup with no CTBs and no Surge has the drivers exactly where Uber wants them.Speaking of Surge...talk about unethical....I've been seeing my Uber map constantly showing grey areas (which are supposed to show an increase in ride request activity), but funny how surge never actually materializes. An area has an increase in ride requests for 8 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours every day, but never enough for surge? Oh it's surging alright...just for the passengers.Doesn't help that there are more drivers out and about, after PUA / UI / EIDL / PPP funds have been depleted, plus potentially more drivers on the road with the Great Resignation reset, not to mention more part timers trying to make some extra Christmas cash.For me, ya gotta have all 3: Surge + CTB + Quest to make this gig worthwhile."
Throttling trips?,Mighty2293,hnop619,hnojvim,Yeah I thought it was my account or something too because normally it’s pretty quick to pick up a ride. Airport waiting lot has probably been 25%+ more full as well. Most likely people just driving to buy Holiday gifts etc for this month
Anyone else making money off cancellations during rides?,brothenberg,rb9ah9,0,"Uber is sending me ride request with 20-30mns left in my current ride? Why?1.

Because of this I've been shutting off ride request to avoid getting request 20-30mns in advance, if Uber wants to play games, I'll play back! just turn it off till I'm 2mns away from dropping them off.I said screw it and started to accept one or two while I had 30mns left in current ride, and I had 4-5 cancellations, 2 of which I made $ on.. so I made $7 by accepting their early ride request..Which is kind of screw up for the customer! since they got charged!

Anyone else making money off cancellations during rides?,richietee757,hnn03n0,rb9ah9,Customer gets a general ETA when they request a ride.  Customer gets a more specific eta with a message that you are still completing a ride when you accept.I don't think a customer gets charged unless you are on the way to pick them up.  That's weird that they would send you requests when you still have 20 minutes left.  There must have been no other Uber drivers out at the time!

Insurance. Uber. Accidents?,boardslacked,rbarqy,0,"I was recently involved in an accident with a rider in my vehicle. I was hit by an unlicensed driver in a parking lot. After speaking with AllState (uber's preferred insurance provider), they let me know that if I wanted to file with them, they have a $2500 dollar deductible. I am no expert, but if you are even the slightest at fault in an accident, you will have to pay that amount out of pocket which seems really excessive. This makes me reconsider ever driving for uber during inclement weather as you are really ""rolling the dice"" when it comes to the possibility of encountering a really excessive personal liability. I am still working to get my $3300 dollars covered by the other parties' insurance company, but I found this fact to be very eye opening. If they refuse to pay, I will be out a considerable amount of money. I also learned that Uber changes these policies every single year, so its extremely important to review these changes in detail and evaluate 1. you have the correct gap insurance policy and 2. if  the risk of an accident really worth driving for Uber at all.

New driver,Kevinmd84,rbggqa,0,Hi everyone! 2 years Eats driver staring to do rideshare. I live in the Winston Salem NC area: I’ve heard Charlotte has been nuts. Did my first long trip today to Charlotte. Made $100; mind was blown. Would like to hear anyone else’s success in Charlotte
New driver,pakrat1967,hno9iah,rbggqa,After almost 4 years doing Uber.  I've had at least 12 trips from Asheville to Charlotte.  I would usually stick around and get some trips there before heading back.  And while I was never lucky enough to get a return trip all the way back to Asheville.  I did get some trips around Gastonia and Shelby.
New driver,gamikzone,hnoh426,rbggqa,I haven't been to Charlotte yet. But I did have a trip from Myrtle Beach to Charlotte I had to decline because I was driving a PAX to Charleston. I heard Charlotte is nuts as well. Charleston was surging at the airport all day today.

The guy that says 'just give me cash' isn't putting your rental income on their tax return - and you have no way to prove you paid rent , which can cause a problem.

They're adding $7-8 per trip where ur at. Nowadays it's like $2 per trip where I'm at. Even $12 for 3 rides is better than Uber here, if u get to do multiple 3 ride streaks in a day. $4 extra per ride, pretty good if ur doing short stay in the city rides. & u don't even have to commit to doing an entire big amount to get all or nothing.

What should I say to convince my boss to tip when my job orders ubers for clients?,irishWhistlr,hnly1wl,hnlfkdv,"Yeah, this is how I operate. I guess it depends on the market, but here there are better options than to take these type of rides. The only positives to these 3rd party rides are that you don't really have to be ""on"" 100% because the rider will not be the one actually rating or tipping you (unless they have cash).In my opinion, the rating of this business account will end up tanking eventually. You let enough 3rd party riders ride on your account, this will happen as a matter of course. Even if OP convinces their boss to tip (thank you for the concern!), drivers don't actually see this until AFTER the ride so it does not actually affect rating or make drivers more likely to pick up and service the business' customers. It's a shitty system but that's how it works unfortunately on Uber anyway."

How do you get Uber Rides quests?,noideasforcoolnames,rb7tdi,0,"I applied for Uber X a few weeks back and got rides quests for 2 weeks,  but then they went away because I didn't do any rides. They said ""We’ll  reassess your preferred trip type on a weekly basis, and we’ll  notify  you if there are any updates in the promotions you’re eligible to   receive."" I've heard people say you need to do a certain percentage of  rides/deliveries to get the quests. Can anyone confirm?"
How do you get Uber Rides quests?,Accomplished-Home471,hnmq0ww,rb7tdi,Wait until the summer. Quests will be back
How do you get Uber Rides quests?,richietee757,hnmqmd9,rb7tdi,It depends on the market.They don't go away because you didn't do any rides.They may have gone away because a bunch of other drivers applied also and they're covered.The quests are for days/times when their algorithm determines that they won't have enough drivers in your area.
How do you get Uber Rides quests?,pantera236,hno99mk,rb7tdi,"I'm in the same boat as you. I started with eats only and started doing rides earlier this year. Didn't really like it but was digging the ride quests and noticed that eats counted towards the quests. Thought I hit the jackpot. Till they sent me the same thing. I can't survive in my market right now with eats and no quests alone so now I do both. They told me one time that you have to do at least half rides. Not sure how they track it, but you will get them back if you do ""more than half rides"""
How do you get Uber Rides quests?,glittersparklythings,hnmte50,hnmqmd9,"They can go away for not doing them. I had them. And bc I did only eats and not rides, they went away and haven’t had a uberx quest since. I got the same message. It stated bc I did more eats than rides, my quests would be going away.Uber eats doesn’t get the same amount of quests as Uber x. I think it is to make up for the lack of tipping."

How do you get Uber Rides quests?,richietee757,hnmx6u5,hnmte50,Weird.  I guess it differs by market.  I rarely ever do Uber X rides.  I mostly only do Uber Eats.  I get quests every week... but the quests I get are usually good for either Uber Eats or Uber X.  I did get a quest last week to do 5 Uber X rides for an extra $40 which I did.  But the only time I do Uber X is when I get a quest like that for Uber X only.

Do mostly eats in one period and then moxtly x in the other and see if they change it up?  They did this because you were doing mostly eats.  Only makes sense that if you start doing mostly x they will change it back.
How do you get Uber Rides quests?,glittersparklythings,hno3wwq,hnn0apx,Just where the passenger is. It will tell if it is more than 30 or 45 minutes though (can’t remember what one). Once you do a certain amount of rides from what I have red on here it will tell you general info. Like where the ride is going and how long.

Brand new to uber eats question,Greg8642,rbcqdj,0,"Hi there, Absolute noob here looking at becoming an uber eats driver in Niagara Falls Ontario canada.  I've set up my account and uploaded all the documents except for the safety inspection which I'm going to get done next week.  I've noticed though that there are things one should do that could be missed. For example, here on this page nothing is mentioned about notifying your insurance company that your going to be using your vehicle commercially. https://www.uber.com/ca/en/deliver/ I did come across that somewhere in my searching though, so I'll be sure to give them a call.   Now I have to wonder if maybe there are other things I havent come across that I need to do?  Basically all I've done now is setup the account, so are there other boxes I should check before starting?  Thanks for any tips."
Brand new to uber eats question,Allthis_andwar,hnnlr7d,rbcqdj,You might not even need the safety inspection. I didn’t even though they said I did. Also they only care that you can provide proof of insurance. Someone I know if driving without insurance altogether lol they just had it when they first signed up.
Need advice!,PARISLATOKYO,rbbp9f,0,College girl i picked up asked if i had an extra mask she could have.  I said yes and gave her my last disposable mask.  I drop her off at her destination and turn around to see she left her old dirty mask on the ground in the back seat AND she didnt tip for the mask i gave her.  What should i do? I dropped her off at a restaurant where she says shes going in for orientation.

Need advice!,ThatsFishyYoureFishy,hno7h28,rbbp9f,"You can still go ahead and let uber know she wasn't wearing a mask and have her blocked from your account. The mask rule means it must be on the ENTIRE ride, and her removing it in your car prior to leaving means she didn't. She probably took it off the minute you started paying less attention to her to start driving and only asked for one to appear she was compliant with your and uber's rules. Enough of these mask complaints will get her removed from the platform."

On my way to 100k… update 12/6,breadhead1,hnhff8t,rad0jn,"Grindin Grandpa… the food delivery machine.Driving around Los Angeles, California collecting $10 bills. Last week I found 231 $10 bills. Another safe and productive week no tickets and no accidents.🤗Only 85 days remaining until February 28 to complete my mission! I’m looking forward to getting back to more time off and just working whenever I feel like it.😁UberEats has transferred a total of $80,307.80 into my checking account since March 1st of this year. I need to earn another $19,733.00 between now and February 28th to accomplish my goal of $100,000 of UberEats income in a 12 month period. Some of those earnings will come from Prop 22 payments for my healthcare stipend and my minimum earnings guarantee. Minimum earnings guarantee payments come every other week and have been averaging $275… or more. The healthcare stipend is paid the 1st of every calendar quarter and averages $409 per month. So I’m counting on receiving another $3,700 of Prop 22 payments by February 28. So Grindin Grandpa needs to earn only $16,033.00 more money from today until February 28th in my car to accomplish my goal of $100,000 in 1 year income as an UberEats driver. I don’t multi app or drive passengers. I’m just a food delivery machine.😁There have been 280 days since March 1st, my starting date of this mission, until today and I’ve taken 19 days off during that time and worked extra hours on other days to make up for that lost revenue. So I’ve worked a total of 261 days for UberEats. In that time I’ve made:$80,307.80… or $307.69 per day, which includes all Prop 22 payments too. 7024 delivers… an average of 26.91 per day at an average revenue of $11.43 for every delivery.I’ve driven 36,500 miles… an average of 139.84 miles per day. My car gets 45mpg so I’ve used 811.11 gallons of gas at about $4 per gallon… $3,244, or 0.04039% of my revenue. UberEats has paid me $2.20 per mile for EVERY mile I’ve driven my car for them, not just Active miles.The 2015 Toyota Prius I bought specifically for this mission for $6,000 and invested another $3,000 in repairs to get it road ready… has been paid for by this project many times over. So for you trolls that hate UberEats and the food delivery business… you CAN actually make a profit doing this without ruining your car.🤑  Surprise, surprise, surprise!!!I need to make just $16,033.00 over the remaining 85 days or $188.62 per day… to accomplish my goal. If I can stay healthy and work everyday… I think I’ve got this.🤗To all of you that are thinking about quitting your job to do food deliveries instead… don’t assume because this old Grandpa can make $100,000 you can too.I couldn’t possibly devoted this much time and effort to a single project at any other time in my life. The time required to accomplish this feat is extraordinary… so don’t think if that old man can do it, so can I. You’re really limited to about $25 per hour for your Online time and about $40 an hour for your Active time. So do the math… it requires many hours a week to accomplish this goal, which I bet you don’t have to devote to making this much money. And when this mission is accomplished… I WILL NOT work this many hours a week ever again in my life!!!Weekly summary… November 29/December 5Revenue… $2309.27 = $329.85 per day.Deliveries… 215 = 30.71 per day. Miles driven… 923 = 131.85 per day. Online hours… 92.5 = $24.96 per hour.Active hours… 52.5 = $43.98 per hour. Fares VS Tips… more Tips than Fares.👍Other earnings… Prop 22 guaranteed earnings payment. I’m grateful that they think I don’t make enough money.😊Thanks to those that have been following my weekly posts about this crazy mission… you keep me motivated to keep going.🤗Your questions will be answered but remember I’m driving during the day… so not promptly.👍I hope everyone has a productive and profitable week… drive safe.👌"

On my way to 100k… update 12/6,amnesty-that,hnl6udq,hnk0twa,"Because you are making at or above minimum wage and 30 cents per mile. It’s pretty cut and dry. The op is not. Prop 22 is not a bonus to your earnings, it’s to make sure you make the minimum amount per active hours online. OP is not, in fact OP is not even coming close some months.In California Uber wants you to make at least minimum wage and then at least 20% more than minimum wage to cover “some” of gas or maintenance. If you are not receiving it it’s because you are making more than that per active hour. For this post 984/92 hours = $10.69/hrProp 22 brings that to = $13.68/hrTips brings it to $25/hrBut being online for that long seems to be part of the OP plan because it’s his goal to collect prop 22 minimums.

On my way to 100k… update 12/6,Aloysius7,hnli0j7,hnk821o,"A lot of assumptions there buddy. I don't believe you at all, either.In 2018 I had a job making $35k as a W2 employee, I had a side hustle that brought in $50k in cash that I didn't claim, and also sold an investment property that profited $150k that was exempt from taxes. I paid off over $70k in debts (not student loans, never had any).2019 I left that job after half a year (~$17k). Side hustle made $70k, created a new company for a large project that brought in $189k from Aug '19 - Feb '20.Then COVID happened. The only other money I made in 2020 was selling my house while exiting a relationship. Made $90k on the sale, also tax free. I didn't start working again until October of this year, I took 19 months off where all I did was spend spend spend. It was amazing, and has been my favorite time for obvious reasons.Earlier this year I invested $35k into my girlfriend's business to get her off the ground, she's done so well I decided to join in October to help scale because there was only so much she could handle herself. As a team, were projecting $180k in 2022.As for savings, I have a little under $100k (part of it invested, most liquid).And since I effectively spent 19 months in semi-retirement, I realized that at 36 years old I have decades left to continue to earn, because even $5M saved wouldn't be enough for me to retire the way I want.Oh, and as for taxes I've been able to write off plenty. I paid less in taxes in these years than I got in stimulus money."

But I sold my house for double what I paid in '14 so regardless, it's a win. We will buy a home next year that will fit as a perfect rental and decide to stay where we are and try that out.

Unofficial rules/minimums for accepting food deliveries?,FaultyData,rb1k3d,0,"I tried out DoorDash for a tiny bit a couple years ago and one of the unofficial rules a lot of drivers had was to not accept orders less than $1 per mile.  I just signed up as an UberEats driver and waiting for the pay card to arrive. What are the unofficial rules are as a delivery driver for Uber?  Is the $1/mile thing pretty standard for all delivery platforms?  How do tips work here?  (There was a big stink about DD doing shady stuff with tips a couple years ago)E: thanks for the replies, guys!  Def some good info I never would have thought of until I got burned."

Unofficial rules/minimums for accepting food deliveries?,AskTheTiger,hnm4z78,rb1k3d,Don't accept orders from Party City unless you can accommodate a car full of balloons.
Unofficial rules/minimums for accepting food deliveries?,powerdriveexpressllc,hnlr38q,rb1k3d,"I do $1 mile if it's within the vicinity I try to stay in. $1.50/mile if it takes me outside that.  It costs about .50 per mile to operate my vehicle with wear and tear.  $1 will more than cover local deliveries, $1.50 will usually cover the trip back if outside that vicinity. I always end up with an excellent $/mile ratio.  With Uber, tips aren't credited to your driver account until one hour later because customers have one hour to change the amount or cancel the tip."
Unofficial rules/minimums for accepting food deliveries?,By-the-order,hnme9vj,rb1k3d,Also consider hourly rate if a job is going to take 20 minutes then make sure it pays 1/3 of your hourly rate goal. Example a 20 minute order would have to be at least $8 even if it is only 1 mile.
Unofficial rules/minimums for accepting food deliveries?,Rooster0778,hnmn6i0,rb1k3d,"I tend to think in terms of dollars per hour. I rarely take anything under $7, even if it's across the street, or $2 a mile. Time of day. 5 miles on Saturday morning is a lot different than 5pm weekdays. I'll do it for $10 when there's no traffic but during rush hour it's got to be closer to $20. Also you can afford to be picky during dinner rush. Learn your restaurants, there are several I know are going to be a time sink and only take fat orders from. Also ones that are consistently quick I'll take something a little cheaper at. Where it's going to land you. If I'm taking something out to where there's not much work it's got to pay better to make up for the time headed back, but if know there's good opportunities where I'm dropping off I'll take a little less. Learn to know when to cut bait. If an order isn't ready when you arrive don't be afraid to confirm that they are at least aware of it and get an ETA for it. Sometimes it's already been picked up or someone stole it or they aren't paying attention to their tablets, but nobody's paying for your time waiting. Don't waste time dropping either. If it's a meet at the door and they don't answer the buzzer or phone right away, fuck that 8 minute timer, send them a text saying you rang and called and will leave the order wherever you're leaving it. Hope that helps, best of luck"
Unofficial rules/minimums for accepting food deliveries?,PapaMurphy2000,hnme63z,rb1k3d,$1 a mile? Holy shit that's low. I don't have a hard and fast rule since there are more factors than just $/mile for me. But $2/mile would be absolutely bare minimum. Last night I did 2 deliveries. One was $17 and one was $12. The $17 one was 4ish miles and the $12 was 5ish. If it's not in that ballpark I don't accept.
Unofficial rules/minimums for accepting food deliveries?,Alex-0049,hnlyk9n,hnlqf2v,Did Uber eats in the past. My experience with the pay card was not a problem with the restaurants. They were fine with that. But what annoyed me that I had to wait way much longer for the food at the restaurant obviously. Because it is treated as normal walk up the counter order. Sure wait times can happen at normal orders too but with pay card it is a guaranteed wait at the restaurant

Ubereats to uberx!,fly91012,hnmnqtp,rb6hak,"I had the same question when i started doing uberx after uber eats for so long. 1.) u cant see where the customer is going until you pick them up2.) you dont know how much you made u til you dropped them off3.) more than half the time they wont tip so what you see there is usually what you will make4.) they only warn you if the trips 45 minutes or longer, ive had to drive 35 minutes multiple times and it wasnt worth it5.) a big suggestion, look at the surge maps for both, if uberx is giving $6-$13 surge pay then sure do it, that’ll compensate for the lack of tip, if not then uber eats is more worth it because you can control your time and mileage and you’re more likely to get tipped because some customers know no tip no trip, unlike uberX where you dont even know what you will get paid till its too lateIn my opinion uberX isnt bad if you dont mind the adventure and you are in a GOOD surge zone like $6-$15 surge zone, and the trips pay more the more time and miles you drive. If the eats surge map is around $3.50 or $4 id do eats because the tip still comes in usuallyHope this helps!"

Short rant,FlashyCow1,rb4tlg,0,Dead slow. Only 5 rides in 8 hours. My worst passenger who was demanding and smelled of moth balls was the only one to tip all day on a ride where I made $20.

You have to go knock on doors to make appointments and it’s not for the faint of heart. It’s a lot of rejection.. but if you sell a few a month, it’s easily an additional 3-10k plus. In your down time, go knock doors. When you have deliveries and the neighborhood looks good, knock on doors. I’ve done solar myself (I made like 70 something first year but the door knockers who were good made over 100k) but I was not a door knocker. I just went to appointments. Then I tried the door knocking for a diff company and I hated it. The guy I worked with there made 100k in like 6 months because he was good at it. So if you like driving around all day and want to make some money, look into that. There are also solar companies with outreach programs that will pay you $200 or around there if you set an appointment and even more if it sells. It’s the perfect duo, delivering and knocking.

This is what a service dog denial looks like,FiverNZen,ra8y69,0,"I requested an Uber to get to work this morning. The driver was a solid 15 minutes away, which is normal for where i live. I appreciate every single driver who takes the time to come that far to pick me up.The driver arrived and parked about 40 feet down the street from the house. I thought maybe he would turn around and pull into the driveway because he had perhaps accidentally driven past the house which has happened before, but he didn’t so I walked down the street and crossed over to him with my guide dog. I located the front of his car by feel as i am totally blind and decided that I would go around the back of his car to the back passenger seat as I always do. As i did this, he began to slowly pull away, drove down the street, sat there for another minute and then drove away.I have met some of the kindest people using rideshare but this experience was frustrating and disheartening more than I can really express. He did not bother having a dialog with me; apparently I wasn’t  weren’t  that. I was extremely late to work and if I didn’t have the job or supervisor that I do I could very well be unemployed for tardiness.I share this in the hopes that maybe it can help other drivers understand how frustrating and upsetting discrimination like this is, especially since passengers with disabilities rely on things like Uber and Lyft  more than most do for independence. We don’t have the luxury of driving on our own (and trust me, you don’t want me on the road anyway ;)).  If I had the option to avoid inconveniencing others for transportation trust me—i’d do it in a second.

The driver completely refused to do so. She was confused bc she also had her kids then so it made no sense to just drive a couple hundred more feet. So she just told her this happens often and that it was a mistake and that if she could please drive up. The driver screamed at her and said she didn’t feel safe. That it wasn’t her problem (driver was female) and that she needed to exit her vehicle bc her gps ended there and thats where it was ending.

I was speechless and a bit heartbroken i just still can’t believe it. Made her and the kids walk. They were so incredibly kind from the beginning hope they never experience that again. As far as for the driver i hope she runs out of gas and has to walk to get it. BITCH. (Sorry not sorry)"

Just know that he’s probably just a shitty person too, not just a shitty person to you.

This is what a service dog denial looks like,Huge_Confection6124,hni35y0,ra8y69,I have had one blind rider with a guide dog. I was actually really excited to help them out. I made sure that I parked in an easy to find spot and when I dropped them off I made sure I was straight from the front door so they could easily find their way inside. The guide dog was respectful but peed a little on my seat :( I couldn’t report him because obviously the owner didn’t notice and I felt bad. This was when I had fabric seats. Now I turn off Uber pet and have decided to not accept an animal unless I happen to get a guide dog again. And in that situation I’ll make them sit on a towel i Keep in the trunk now.

Hopefully OP posted looking for support which is totally here, but more importantly advice on how to live his life free of this kind of treatment from us the system.  and overwhelmingly people think ordering uber pet, and sending a concise message to the driver is the way to go.  will he never be discriminated against again, no, but his odds go up tremendously."

If the proof is plausible, 2 strikes for deactivation. There is a responsible person for compliance so you should reach the team for that.And the settlement requires drivers to be trained. We have to watch videos. But the problem is, they do not tell drivers that they can be deactivated after one or two incidents.A driver even claimed to get away with proof of his allergy to dogs.As for proof, if you can, sent a canned text to the driver that you are blind and have a service dog.

Sadly as we are not employees of Uber and using our personal cars we are basically allowed to discriminate anyone for anything and bail on a ride, and while we probably wont get any money for it it goes unpunished.  I for one love animals and get excited when i see an uber pets pick up or someone who just assumed id take them with their pet, so if you just ordered uber pet rides, while you may pay a little more (never noticed it on my end) you are going to get someone who loves, or at least tolerates animals.  the other big tip i would give is to send a message to your driver to confirm the address is correct and ask them to pull in the driveway.  you would be surprised how often people order us to their neighbors house, and how often said neighbor comes outside angry about it.  or how often someone's driveway damages the bottom of our cars."

If this doesn't work for you, at least message the driver ahead of time so that if this happens you don't waste both your time and theirs.

The driver will just offer whatever justification they feel is necessary: that the animal made them feel unsafe, they didn’t know you were blind, couldn’t find you, etc., and Uber will accept that and let them keep rolling (unless they have tons of ADA complaints). Instead, you could get a driver that you know unequivocally will be okay with the dog for a few bucks more. Thus saving everyone time and energy."

This is what a service dog denial looks like,senneth74,hnnufz9,hnmzy83,You're confusing parts of the ADA law the part that concerns service animals says that they have to have Equal access and it says specifically that they can not be charged extra for the same service. Just like Uber clearly states in the documents you sign to be a driver that you have to take them you don't have the option to say no even if you're allergic. I do think Uber should have a section when riders sign up that let's them say they have a service animal and then give them a special account that sends the riders to Pets drivers but at the same cost since we do Uber X rides as well but I don't know if they can legally do it to everyone or if they even can.
This is what a service dog denial looks like,kreeves500,hnp1e81,hnmzy83,"Please take a few minutes to read the ADA laws and educate yourself. With every comment you sound more ignorant of the law. Uber pet is for pets, not service animals.  Under the federal ADA law, Uber cannot charge more for having a service dog, meaning they cannot be required to use premium services like pet or assist."

This is what a service dog denial looks like,senneth74,hnj0fp6,hnin9ph,I get it the issue is that Uber pets charges more and that violates the law you can't charge them more. Maybe the best solution now would be to have a question when signing up about service animals and then have special coding that gives them a pets account but with regular Uber prices. But that makes sense and I just don't want anyone to get jammed up not understanding the law
This is what a service dog denial looks like,senneth74,hnk5u1r,hnjxhnk,I get it having thought more about it I've come to the conclusion that the best thing Uber can do would be to have a section that they could add their service animals on and then give them a special Pets account that is coded to give regular Uber prices that would solve a lot of the issues and if it's voluntary that should not violate the law. Cause the thing is being afraid of the dog is not a valid defense they only have to prove the driver refused the ride because of the dog. Having lost 2 ADA cases already and having to pay close to 2 million on them I don't know if they want to challenge the NFB since they now have to send them copies of all complaints of drivers not taking service dogs as part of the settlement.
This is what a service dog denial looks like,senneth74,hnj3siw,hnhjf43,2 complaints that's it that's all it takes 2 credible complaints and they will deactivate you. The thing is a lot of the people who this happens to don't report it. A non Uber pet driver has signed paperwork saying they will take service animals and acknowledging that there is no justification to refuse them including being afraid of dogs. They are not going to put themselves out and make themselves liable. If it can be proven that you are refusing a ride for having a service dog or making people with service dogs pay more and that person decides to sue the first violation can be up to 75000 with each additional violation up to 150000. Now most cases are settled for a lot less like 26000 but since we aren't Uber employees and just contractors all Uber has to do is show the policy and show that we agreed to and signed it. Then we violated it and when told they took action and it puts the liability on us and contractors can be held liable. Yeah it'll probably never happen but I'm not going to test that assumption
This is what a service dog denial looks like,FiverNZen,hnhowij,hnhn83w,It’s really hard for me to believe that he didn’t see me when I was standing right beside his window and was actively moving around his car to get in…  and if he really wasn’t sure where I was wouldn’t he have waited for five minutes or whatever is required instead of driving away as I was standing there? i’m really not sure why this is a question of me not texting as a courtesy which I probably will start doing rather than an issue of illegal discrimination/denial.
This is what a service dog denial looks like,FiverNZen,hnhbhvr,hnhb5a6,the fake service dog issue is definitely causing some difficulties out there for sure…I appreciate your comments :) they’ve given me something to think about.
This is what a service dog denial looks like,senneth74,hni486d,hni19hj,And you should read that FAQ as well it clearly states that riders with service dogs are protected by the ADA and do not have to use the new service. You're not protected refusing to give a person with a legitimate service dog a ride. Also if you're going to be that guy at least have the balls to tell the BLIND guy he can't get a ride to work because he needs his service animal to simply get around.
This is what a service dog denial looks like,FiverNZen,hni1j5x,hni19hj,There are definitely situations where a person cannot have a dog in their car.

This is what a service dog denial looks like,SlowestLearner101,hnhib0l,hnhbhvr,"Warning text is the answer. Drivers deal with a lot of BS and have high autonomy to bail. If you lay it all out beforehand so we know what’s coming, it will make it smoother for everyone. The way I look at it, it is the passenger’s responsibility to ensure that they get the ride — that means if they need to call or text or have some type of special need, they need to communicate that to me without being prompted… simply because of the relative negotiating positions of the parties involved. I can easily cancel and move on to the next ride with very little effort, but it’s going to cost the passenger real time and energy. So they should be the one ensuring the ride gets off to a good start. That being said, I take rides with dogs. But I would still want a text in advance knowing what I’m getting into. If I show up and someone has a dog without having told me in advance, I kinda feel like they were gaming the system, like it says to me, “oh I have this extenuating circumstance that I didn’t bother to share with you because I was afraid you might cancel”. So yeah, warning text is always appreciated and will save everyone time and energy."

This is what a service dog denial looks like,senneth74,hnif6jz,hnhs1ur,What part of it that it's not on the rider to communicate that to us don't y'all understand. You can say it's only right but the person missing an arm doesn't have to text you and tell you. You are legally obligated under law to treat the guy with a service animal the same as the person missing an arm. I know people keep getting hung up on the dog part but you absolutely can not refuse them because they have a service animal. Nor can you tell them to demonstrate it some service dogs are for people with seizures you can't make them have a seizure just to satisfy you. You are allowed to ask what service the preform but the driver would have had to actually roll down the window to talk to OP. As for how OP did things or knows things they learned to live with the disability now he could have been wrong and that may not have been his driver but like you said courtesy would dictate telling your rider you are cancelling there is a message feature in the app. Also I'm not trying to be a dick about it but in a lot of states it's a higher level of  misdemeanor that carries high fines and stays on your record as well as being deactivated and losing your job
This is what a service dog denial looks like,FiverNZen,hnht9pq,hnhsvdu,I heard where the car was and he drove by as the notification came through. I could then hear where he was idling… The street was otherwise empty and no one else drove by. I also have an app called AIRA which allows me to call an individual via a video feed and they can confirm uber/lyft details.
This is what a service dog denial looks like,senneth74,hnibc5d,hni4ctt,"Obviously you missed the I believe second paragraph stating that drivers must follow the service animal policy for service animals that they do not have to pay an extra fee. That policy states that you have to take the rider and you agreed to that when you signed up. Also I'd be careful saying there are more laws protecting drivers there are states that levy fines for refusing service dogs. Think of it this way can you refuse a person for not having an arm, it's the same thing."
This is what a service dog denial looks like,FiverNZen,hni2lpy,hni24kf,"I don’t think we’ll agree so I’ll leave you with this.I did not order the wrong type of service. I ordered an Uber X, which I am entitled to use just like everyone else is regardless of my disability or my having a service dog. It’s called equality and that is why she is not categorized as a pet; because I need her to perform tasks for me. It’s not about the money. It’s about equality and the principle of the matter."

Also the driver stayed the time required to be able to get the cancellation fee and didn't have the courtesy to at least tell OP why so it's not illogical to think the service dog was the reason.
This is what a service dog denial looks like,FiverNZen,hnhvxdd,hnhvfxv,"Lol Reddit is definitely a strange place…sometimes good, sometimes bad and sometimes downright frightening :D.

A driver could get reported a trillion times and they would email you the same canned response about how drivers and riders are required to wear masks.

Wow! Caught the unicorn tonight.,Angela-lala,ra4ec6,0,"I see and hear about drivers getting sweet tips but tonight was my turn!  Got a ping for a comfort ride just a couple of minutes away, i had only comfort on because I was trying to get to the airport without going offline.  Nice surge at airport of about $7.00.  I saw it was a good length, about 30 min out to the suburbs (I don't mind long rides as long as they are not to the boonies).  I pick up a single guy a bit younger than me and we start chatting as is pretty normal.  Great conversation, we talk about pets, driving, memorable rides, family, covid, ECT... He asks what is on my Christmas wish list, I told him nothing major, asked him he said he had pretty much everything he needed.  I drop him off and he handed me cash.  Told me to add something to that Christmas list.  I realize the bill's not a 5 or a 20, it's a 100.  Then I realize there is more than one.  $300.00!  Damm!"

Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,Accomplished-Sky8281,raswv2,0,Do you think I didn’t see you added a stop before I arrived to pick you up?Ride paid 3.43 - 5.00I did a drive by with face mask cancellation.
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,SlowestLearner101,hnl5arp,raswv2,"I don’t take rides with stops. If someone does manage to get in and add a stop or I didn’t see it, I tell them “I can only wait 3 minutes, and I don’t wait at (fast food, grocery store, wherever), because it always takes more than 3 minutes. I will just drop you at (fast food, grocery, whatever), and you can get another car when you are done”. I do this before I start moving, so if they try to argue I tell them, “I am not going to argue about it, but if you’d like you can stay here and try to find another driver”. A lot of times they decide to skip the stop. Might get me a one-star, but who cares. And we all know they weren’t gonna tip anyways. If they offer to tip in the app to keep me around, I tell them, “I’ve been lied to before, so the only way I can do that is a cash tip up front”."
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,Group_HugMTG,hnksazw,raswv2,You guys obviously don't live in any big cities.  This happens to me all the time where a group of friends go out and share an uber. But they all usually live within 2 miles of eachother.
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,AvailableYak5990,hnl8dca,raswv2,I remember accepting an hour ride and then seeing like 6 stops. One of the few rides I actually cancelled after accepting
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,Electronic-Service-5,hno26rl,raswv2,"What they are doing now is waiting until they hop in the car to add a stop. I picked up 3 people one night and as soon as they get in, the guy says can you drop this one along the route. He argued when I told him to add the stop in the app. They are catching on! I hatethesefknpeople."
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,Rickthepickel,hnkgb39,raswv2,"I consider doing this myself but I wanna get promotions. I'll tell pax this ""hey so uber sent us a letter on December 1st, if you are not back in three minutes the app will auto-cancel the ride. I have no controll over this""Each time I say this they either cancel there stop, or come back within 3 minutes. If pax is cool, or if they offer cash I'll say ""okay ill go park a little bit away, which will delay the timer, just text me when your on your way out"". That way they don't think I'm making stuff up."
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,dumb-as-hell-I-am,hnklzxy,raswv2,"I will almost always cancel when they do this, simply on principle of changing the contract without consent. I used to just suck it up and take them but, after drive thru adds, round trips that paid shitty, I said no more."
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,AsianCee,hnl264v,raswv2,New to ubering but what is the problem with adding a stop? Doesn't it add an extra few dollars to the trip? Is it that we object to having to wait at the stop in case they pick up stuff? I'm not sure I understand.
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,kai54321,hnm5yjw,raswv2,I cancel the trip once they add a stop.  Unless I m doing the 3 trios streak.
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,PatrickRedditing,hnohdju,raswv2,I'm sorry.. but with all the false pax reports on drivers...I don't like this... its one thing to take them to there first stop and cancel if they take to long but it's another to false report the pax for something that's not true too..Edit: and most likely the pax didn't know how to add multi stops... because the price would have been the same one way or the other had they booked it properly or not.. plus it doesn't tell you if it's multi stops or not to begin with as a driver...so I don't think they're always trying to get over on you.. but just false reporting Is whack as fuck.
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,_troubled_,hnl0p3l,raswv2,"From what I see on my rider app, there's no option to add a stop before ordering a ride."
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,Angela-lala,hnl0gfz,hnksazw,"I don't mind if it's a case of dropping a person or two off.  I mind the ""we're just going in to pick up one thing""."
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,Accomplished-Sky8281,hno2km6,hno26rl,They have done the same crap to me right after jumping in. I think this dummy screwed up and added it prior to my arrival. Let me do 2 stops for $3.43.
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,SlowestLearner101,hnphyst,hno26rl,I normally just agree to “drop along the route” since it takes hardly any time and Uber compensates the extra mileage if any.
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,Accomplished-Sky8281,hnkgh8l,hnkgb39,I don’t hate stops but don’t add them like your being slick. It’s a cheap ride and I don’t really make more money.
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,ImAlwaysRightHanded,hnl7ym8,hnl264v,So you want a ride to the convenient store and home. It’s 2 miles away. Normally we get $2.66 for driving you there it takes 5 min and wim bam boom we are done with you. Oh but now you added a stop back home now we will make $3.80 and we are dealing with you for up to 13min. Maybe more if we wait for you at the store. $3.80! That’s the problem with short trips with stops.
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,Rickthepickel,hno5n62,hnl264v,"In my area we get paid 11 cents a minute to wait...If a stop is succefully executed and done at the 3 minute mark, that stop makes me an extra 33 cents....."
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,Delusion2k21,hnl31n6,hnl264v,"Nope, adds no extra $....maybe a few cents and its literally bullshit because you have to sit there and wait for the pax to dick around shopping at the liquor store or the convenience store or whatever and they take their sweet ass time."
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,Accomplished-Sky8281,hnoicbf,hnohdju,"I will take pax to stops when they have it in the app and I start the ride. It’s shady when you add it after the fact, or when I’m driving to you.That ride was worth $3.43 - $5.00 in my market California."
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,jminternelia,hnkrq8b,hnkgh8l,"Had a lady ignore my greeting and then add a stop as soon as she got in.Her shit got left in the dollar general parking lot. I had to eat a one star, but she will think twice about pulling that act in the future."
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,Electronic-Service-5,hno2rmm,hnl31n6,"This! Had a woman recently add a stop to a Dollar General. Took 12 mins to come back. The only reason I didn't leave her was that I had a phone call to make, so I didn't mind. Any other time I would have left. They know what they are doing. I'm considering getting a sign that indicates I only wait 5 mins at stops to avoid any conversation."
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,PatrickRedditing,hnoiivn,hnoicbf,"I drive full time to in Dallas. And it's not always shady even I've had trouble as a rider doing multi stops the first few times I did it. Plus everything I stand stays, false reporting is whack as hell from both parties."
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,ImAlwaysRightHanded,hnl75s1,hnkrq8b,"I eat my one star quick with people who add rides or I get cash upfront I tell them take their stuff with them because no one ever makes it back to my car if they didn’t give a cash tip for me to stay.   Most people tip in this situation but the ones who argue never would’ve so fuck them, if they are respectful and believable I’ll allow them to tip me in the app for the stop, I haven’t gotten burned yet."
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,Accomplished-Sky8281,hnoiov4,hnoiivn,"I only report a pax when something is true. I drive full time in California. Maybe it’s worse here, but I think it’s bad everywhere. I don’t like shady paxholes."
Paxhole added stop while I was on my way to pick her up,PatrickRedditing,hnoixkg,hnoiov4,I get where you're coming from as a driver.I was deactivate recently for a false report and I just feel really strongly against any false reporting. It's not cool when you're deactivated for a day or worse for a fake report.

"Knowing everything we know as drivers, I’m betting we could make a killer rideshare app",masterchef227,rammwz,0,"I mean, going from the ground up is a cumulative process involve business, investment trade, shareholders, market feasibility, management design, etc., but I’m talking about just the app.Now I know as drivers we’d like to get paid as much as possible and so probably would be pretty prejudiced to make the app make us money, but here’s the thing; we already know of Uber’s shady and scum my practices so I guess at base, what I’m really saying we could do is design a better formula that’s way more driver friendly.No more surge ghost chases, no more denial of fairs based on bullshit, proper advice and understanding for how you’re devaluing your vehicle for trade-in, better incentives for long rides, bonuses that don’t get disputed long-term and not on Bull, better bonus system, new riders and drivers not getting a rating until a certain number of rides, etc.In essence, let’s do away with the shitty practices and improve vastly on what we know. Like how about providing signal boosters and a better Sat track system for drivers? Or let the fines be higher for making messes in cars depending on driver demand? How about trip quest forgiveness where, if you don’t meet your goal you keep the app on and accept every ride we toss your way"
"Knowing everything we know as drivers, I’m betting we could make a killer rideshare app",angerymonkey,hnj9ku4,rammwz,Here we go again....
"Knowing everything we know as drivers, I’m betting we could make a killer rideshare app",Group_HugMTG,hnjbbso,rammwz,"The simple answer is that 99% of drivers don't know what they are doing and are happy with making 25-30 an hour. These are also the people who wait for 2 hours at an airport queue for 0 bonus.It only took me a month of driving to figure how to make 60+ an hour during peak hours and stick with just that.  I whole heartedly would not want a system that would in any way benefit these mindless drones.   Everytime i order an uber to go to the airport, i ask them about driving and their driving hours and habbits, and ive ran into people with 10k rides that jut do it all wrong and are somehow accepting of it even when i give them advice on how to make 2x the money."

"Knowing everything we know as drivers, I’m betting we could make a killer rideshare app",TeddyBrooseveltSr,hnjyifj,rammwz,The best way these gigs would actually work for people is if they ran as transparent as eBay selling. All the information to compare your rate is provided to you. eBay takes it’s clearly defined cut. The only difference other than business type would be regional and local zone management. The whole app could work on cloud services. The major overhead would be support services. Passenger services would be offered by drivers and delivery offers from customers (fuck the no tip ff)

Inexperienced passenger with a general question!,haleyhurricane,raps7o,0,"Hi all. I was recently in another city that had horrendous street parking so I Ubered from my Airbnb to the place I was going. Had a guy pick me and my friend up within 3 minutes. Easy peasy. This was only the third time I’ve ever used Uber. The driver was insanely nice and friendly and as we pulled up to the destination he said “I’ve got to be honest, you guys seem great, I’m not sure why your rating is so low but I’m going to make sure to rate you 5 stars to bump it up a bit and I’ll keep an eye out for your fare returning home!” I was totally lost on why I would possibly have a low rating. I went into my app and saw it at 4.45 (being completely unaware of how Uber works I thought oh that’s not low at all, but now I know it’s quite low).The only other two rides I’ve ever taken were both during the day to doctors appointments over three years ago when my car was in the shop for a week. I can’t imagine what could’ve tanked me.  Is it as simple as one driver rating me well and one rating me poorly? I don’t have to use Uber often but just incase I have a car issue in the future and I need it, is it much less likely anyone will pick me up? I worry about being in a similar situation to this one where I’m in a strange city trying to get home late at night but instead of someone taking a chance on me…no one being willing to pick me up and being stranded. What would you all recommend?"
Inexperienced passenger with a general question!,Nythain,hnlosvk,raps7o,"My guess is so few rides, one driver rated you low cause they were upset with the trip, not you specifically. A lot of grumpy butt drivers out there."

Anyone tried delivering for Roadie? Rates seem pretty low. Uber collect is a ghost town.,DysthymiaDude39,hnkbh0z,raruyp,DL and signed up to see what it’s like. Rates look pretty weak. Airport luggage pickup and 13 mile drive for $13? No thanks. Another exploitation “gig” app.
Anyone tried delivering for Roadie? Rates seem pretty low. Uber collect is a ghost town.,herodothyote,hnkbku5,raruyp,"I tried Roadie once. Absolutely hated it.It was for Home Depot and I had to wait so long to get my order. It ended up not being worth the $20 because it took way longer than an hour to complete.The delivery process ia confusing too and requires customers to sign or something?Don't expect to make a living with Roadie, but if you're planning a really long trip cross country, you could probably make money delivering something really far away In the same direction you were already headed to.Don't let me stop you from trying it though. Who knows maybe your area is good. My area sucks for Roadie, and I usually have to drive like 2 hours away to San Francisco to actually see any offers that look remotely enticing.I used it like what, 2 years ago?  Who knows if they've improved by then. You only know if it's worth it for you if you actually give it a try.In my opinion, you should try every single gig app at least once just to get a feel for things. I personally am signed up for and ready to work for Lyft, Uber, Uber eatss, grubhub, doordash, Instacart, Shipt, Cornershop, Dumpling, Roadie, Amazon Flex- but TBH I only ever use Instacart and Doordash regularly. Everything else is just a backup for me. You should never put all your eggs in one basket. Sign up for every single service you can in case you get wrongfully deactivated and you need to make money during the 2 weeks or so that it takes for your dispute to be successfully accepted."

A passenger came to my house for a lost iPhone!,AsianCee,ra9qnn,0,"This just happened! A passenger came and apparently banged on my door a few times but I was asleep so I never heard it. And then they persistently called until I finally woke up and heard it and answered it. Turns out they were a passenger from last night and left their iPhone in my car at 10:00 p.m. I drove until 2:00 a.m. so lucky the phone was still there and they took it back. But is it unusual for passengers to come looking for you at your house (using their ""find my iphone"")? Isn't that intrusive and wrong?"
A passenger came to my house for a lost iPhone!,Skids2r,hnh7jos,ra9qnn,"Had this happen to me for the first time as well the other day. I didn't know who's phone it was so I did the the whole ""I found a phone"" submit to Uber. It was 3am and I figured I'd finish sorting it out next day. It had a low battery and was in do not disturb mode so I powered it down. 8am next morning and a couple guys were banging at my door for it. I guess iphones have the ability to track even off; which in turn ended up killing the phones battery cause it wouldn't turn back on when I gave it to them. Definitely chucking it in a bush next time. I don't need strangers coming to my home where my family is sleeping. I'm an Android user as well, so I had no way of charging it or the knowledge of how they operated."

But things happens when people have multiple things to keep track of at the same time. I guess the issue is of communication. I dont know if they could reach the driver immediately should this happen. I can only assume in this particular the user wasn't able to contact help from anyone whether its the driver or Uber and the phone was turned off so calling it won't work and tracked the phone as a last resort.Interesting though the poster said he turned the phone off on another comment in this case how would he hear if they persistently call the number? The customer must had been in panic mode at that time and were finding every available option to get it back. New iphones are very expensive and they may really needed it for a job.

I was shocked at the gall this person had, knocking on my door like a swat raid was in progress.  Showing up unannounced and uninvited to the home where a drivers family lives is absolutely not OK.  I reported him to Uber and the police, just to make sure I’d covered all my bases, and every phone I find now gets turned off and dropped at the police station.I’m not saying everyone out there is planting a tracking device in your car, and a passenger may be harmless.

ok i was disgruntled and ive thought about reservations....,judomaster420,rapyma,0,"if you are smart enough to have cheap snacks handy, (i suggest peanut butter filled pretzles) there are some cases where accepting one can be clutch, and im realizing it right now.  if your ride will be during rush hour, but likely avoid the bad traffic and be quite a nice ride assuming typical conditions it may be worth it.....if u like planning a break for a nice lunch...u got those pretzle nugs just incase your ap pops off, which is best case scenerio, all the way until that reservation, otherwise u just hold that pee, and that hungry stomach until the rides go dry hit a bathroom, get a nice lunch and head over.  i still think if u want to stay busy all day and it seems right where you want to be when you want to be there, the forced downtime before the ride still kills it.  and if the ride is right into the parking lot forget about it.  i picked up a rando reservation someone else dropped just like a regular ride but for me a $total was not typical info so i knew something was up.  rider got in and i confirmed they made a reservation.  a few minutes down the road i remembered looking at it a few days earlier thinking naaaa.  but in the stream of my day it worked out fine since i never had down time before the ride.  it mustve just became the highest priority scheduled ride and i was clostest willing."

Uber claimed that most drivers don’t take short from the airport down to like el segundo or Manhattan because they were worth it after you waited in the lot for half a hour. So they bump the minimum payment to 15 dollars for any short trip from the airport. In return they cut the mileage rate so long trips ain’t worth shit

Uber Ride Share Insurance,Cherry_3point141,ranki8,0,"Hey looking for some help and wondering if anyone here can offer some clarity because actually talking to Insurance reps is doing nothing.For context I drive Uber in Canada, Alberta to be exact.I have signed up, been driving for a couple of months but really wanted to know more about the insurance if I was involved in an accident.Called my Insurance provider who holds my regular vehicle insurance and was told wasn't covered if I was on route to pick up a passenger.  But to be honest the person I was speaking to seemed fucking clueless and kept interrupting me with these super annoying ""mmmms, mmms"".  They claimed there has been people in the past who have gotten into accidents while on route to pick up a passenger but Uber says they will only cover them if the passenger is in the vehicle.But if I read my insurance under my app correctly, it clearly states under Bodily Injury and Property damagePeriod 1 (App on) 1,000, 000Period 2 (On way)/Period 3 (on trip) 2,000, 000 Comprehensive CoveragePeriod 2 (on way)/Period 3 (on trip) -Actual cash value subject to $1,000 deductible.&#x200B;If I am reading this correctly I am fucked if I get involved in an accident that damages my car while on route to pick up a passenger, but if I injury someone while on route I will be covered for at least $1,000,000 and $2,000,000 if the passenger is in the vehicle with me.I have these different insurance companies trying to sell me additional rideshare insurance, but NOT A SINGLE FUCKING REPRESENTATIVE can explain to me what exactly is covered in their insurance, or how it works.  Annoying as fuck!Do any Uber drivers here in Canada, AB hopefully have additional insurance other than their regular car insurance, and the Uber insurance?  Also I was told that Uber eats, Skip the Dishes (which I don't do) Door Dash, and Uber Connect are NOT covered as well, and that I require commercial insurance for that.  I was told most people in this province delivering food for these apps are NOT covered if they are in an accident."
Uber Ride Share Insurance,fitfulbrain,hnjn34e,ranki8,"It's not just the insurance agents, but everybody is clueless. You have to blame Uber for using words such as Period 1 and contingence. Certainly, on-way is covered, same as on-trip. So it never has to deal with two separate cases when they are exactly the same. Need some serious spanking.But you need rideshare insurance because during app-on, nobody is covering your car, uninsured."
Uber Ride Share Insurance,AlmasyTran,hnl2kg4,ranki8,"It’s always confusing like that. For food delivery, most drivers will never tell the insurance company that they’re doing delivery, and the company almost always have nothing to prove it otherwise. Basically insurance fraud but pretty sure most drivers are doing the same way."
Uber Ride Share Insurance,dabva,hnlu163,ranki8,"In my state, a rideshare endorsement covers rideshare and delivery apps. Every state is different, and I have no clue about Canada.  https://www.progressive.com/auto/insurance-coverages/rideshare/"
Uber Ride Share Insurance,Ordinary-Article-917,hnkdge8,hnjn34e,If I get into an accident during app on or even en route to trip I ain’t telling Uber or my insurance company anything I turn the app off cancel the ride if I was en route and just tell my personal insurance I was doing errands or going to a friends house ain’t got time or the funds to deal with Ubers stupid insurance or their $2500 deductible BS
Uber Ride Share Insurance,fitfulbrain,hnlpkaw,hnkdge8,"Anybody who wants to do that should consider many factors befrore committing insurance fraud.The rideshare option doesn't cost that much. Because it doesn't cover much, only your car when you are waiting for requests. It's a lot more common now that you can get the quote online for major insurers. Some rideshare option reduces your Uber deductible to the same as your personal deductible, say, $500. That's called deductible reimbursement. It has nothing to do with Uber. You are insuring a small amount of $2500. So it shouldn't cost that much. But if you have savings or credit more than that, it's always not worthwhile to insure an amount that you can otherwise afford - insurance 101.If you don't have the rideshare option, you have to lie right off the bat. They will ask everybody if you were driving for Uber for all accidents.Insurers cannot go to all employers in the world to check if you are driving commercially during the accident. But once you have an accident and the insurance goes through Uber, you will be in an industrial database that shows you had been a rideshare driver. The insurer may ask you for proof that you were not Ubering during the accident. If you ever put on your Uber sticker, your own dashcam is likely to be the witness. And that many drivers have their dashcam pointing at your stickers. And the other driver is very likely to see your sticker and even make a claim direct to Uber."
Uber Ride Share Insurance,Ordinary-Article-917,hnm0si6,hnlpkaw,I got in an accident on the way home from driving for Uber that totaled my car some idiot girl rear ended me at 45 mph at a red light $22k in damage I wasn’t on app at the time but my insurance company knows I drive Uber and never questioned it once
Uber Ride Share Insurance,fitfulbrain,hnmegg3,hnm0si6,So it depends on the insurer. I use one of the big guys. I only started less than 6 month.

Do drivers not get to see estimated fare or distance prior to accepting a passenger pick up?,RevolutionaryTiger73,rac9k3,0,New driver here. Been driving UE for a while and am used to seeing estimated $ and distance. Started Uber X last week and all it gives me is the users rating and distance from my location to pick up location. No fare estimate. No mileage estimate for trip. How do you know if you should accept or not if you don’t know if it’s 2 miles or 200? Or if it’s $5 or $50?
Do drivers not get to see estimated fare or distance prior to accepting a passenger pick up?,nana10rose,hnhd0n9,rac9k3,"But they claim we are independent contractors. when I used to drive I used to ask the passengers where to they usually reply if it doest make me money I cancel. also since you new going to give you head up, if somebody request a ride and they claim they are Uber support is a scam. don't give your information to anybody who claim they with Uber who request a ride. don't fall for Uber support scam, Uber diplomatic scam, Uber will never request a ride. if you ever get those ride wait 5 cancel and collect."
Do drivers not get to see estimated fare or distance prior to accepting a passenger pick up?,Nythain,hnhbluv,rac9k3,"Short answer, no. Long answer, Cali gets distance and direction by maintaining a 5 out of last 10 acceptance rate. Almost everyone else gets distance and direction with Uber gold. And a few markets get all the info fare dropoff etc as part of a pilot program."
Do drivers not get to see estimated fare or distance prior to accepting a passenger pick up?,mikeymo1741,hnjezp3,rac9k3,"I'm in the same boat as you.  Eats for about a year, X for a little over a month.   Eats is way better money when it's popping.  What I do is start a shift with only eats on.  Usually I start driving around 530pm.  Once dinner slows down I turn on rides.  I've had some of my best nights doing that.  Also if it's a slow food night I turn on rides.  I also found that if a delivery takes me somewhere there are few restaurants, I can often use rides to get back to a busier area.  Don't chase ""premium pickup"" money, it's a scam.  I try to stick to rides that are within 8 minutes so I can turn and burn.  I've made some decent money on longer rides but if your chasing a quest that works against you.  The app will tell you upfront if the projected trip is longer than 45 minutes, that's it.  4 minutes or 44 minutes, it's all the same."
Do drivers not get to see estimated fare or distance prior to accepting a passenger pick up?,Rob_Marc,hnhb71u,rac9k3,"With a ""Pro"" status (gold, platinum, or diamond), you can see estimated trip duration and direction, but as far as an estimated fare, nope. You will get the hang of it, and you'll know about what you should earn on a 15 minute trip and so on. Either way, the money is much better driving people around vs. picking up orders for delivery."
Do drivers not get to see estimated fare or distance prior to accepting a passenger pick up?,StrangFrut,hnitel8,rac9k3,"some markets, yes, they do not get to see it. Other markets we get the destination & fare estimate.Yr last question is the age old driver question since 2013. We had to do stuff like pull up, then start the trip & find out. I member one doosh, I said ""oh shit, sorry I can't go all the way there. Sorry I wasted yr time, if I'd known I wouldn't have accepted. The next driver probably won't realize it's bad to do those trips"". & white guy tech bro is all ""that's *why* u don' t get to see the destination."" In other words, he is happy to know the driver got tricked into doing something unprofitable as long as it gets them where they're going cheap. It doesn't pay to leave some cities if ur surrounded by suburbs with way lower rates & way less rides, & an empty drive back that ends up leaving u with about 45c a mile for that trip by the time u get back."

Thought I’d ask here and see if this is normal or not…Uber did some funky stuff with my account last week so I was hoping it was just a glitch.
Do drivers not get to see estimated fare or distance prior to accepting a passenger pick up?,maximagent,hnhh5dq,hnhf4ay,Nah you can’t see it unless you keep your cancellation and acceptance rate at par. But showing you the info you’d have to almost always accept anyways in order to keep seeing the info which defeats the purpose.
Do drivers not get to see estimated fare or distance prior to accepting a passenger pick up?,RevolutionaryTiger73,hnhhdhm,hnhh5dq,"Yeah that doesn’t make sense to me. And why they would do this different than UE, dumb. I guess my UX run was short lived because I won’t play their games. Good luck fellow drivers…I’m out on this one. 🤣"
Do drivers not get to see estimated fare or distance prior to accepting a passenger pick up?,Nythain,hnhiku2,hnhhdhm,Just wait. They are currently rolling out a Cali like system for eats where you will have to maintain a 5 or more out of last 10 acceptance rate to see all your info. Might as well get used to it now lol.
Do drivers not get to see estimated fare or distance prior to accepting a passenger pick up?,RevolutionaryTiger73,hnhj10r,hnhiku2,"Guess I need to find a new side hustle. Lol. I just called Uber support and they said I should be seeing rate and delivery location before acceptance, which goes against what those on here are telling me. Uber “fixed” my account, supposedly so we’ll see. Tried to test by ordering myself a ride in the order app but instead of Uber giving the ride to me (at the same pickup location), they gave it to someone 30 miles away. Explain that one! Hahaha."
Do drivers not get to see estimated fare or distance prior to accepting a passenger pick up?,Nythain,hnhjly4,hnhj10r,"Uber algo is more complex than ""nearest driver"".  And they actually stopped assigning rides too close of proximity to fight against an old popular fraud tactic clever drivers used to use a long time ago.That said, it looks at all the drivers available in the area, and tries to keep it where pax are waiting x amount of time and drivers are racking up y amount of dead miles."
Last couple rides to finish a quest be crazy af….,maximagent,ra3l7h,0,Needed two rides to go to finish a quest and Uber decides to give me nothing downtown. I finally get a ping and I show up…riders not there. It’s night so I don’t just stop in sketchy parts of town…I keep driving but call the customer. She says she has a baby at 1 am. I ask if she had a car seat. She says no. I tell her sorry but you need a car seat. She makes me cancel. Uber doesn’t send me another ride till 40 minutes later driving all throughout a busy ass city. I drive near all the way home and Uber finally wants to send me out into the country 30 minutes in the middle of nowhere. They don’t want to give up quest money unless you drive to the moon with Freddy Krueger on your back. I never have a problem getting a ping like this until I’m near the end of a quest.
Last couple rides to finish a quest be crazy af….,captrobert57,hnfxoz3,ra3l7h,You should have waited the timer to get your cancel fee. It is their fault  no car seat.

Last couple rides to finish a quest be crazy af….,HustleQueen77,hnfy9z8,ra3l7h,It seems to me they want certain drivers out working & are intentionally making it hard for them to complete the quests.

Last couple rides to finish a quest be crazy af….,addyleo,hni5tnx,ra3l7h,It’s evil they do that. Taking the carrot away at the tippy end . Happen to me a few times.
Last couple rides to finish a quest be crazy af….,CIAMom420,hnh53dg,ra3l7h,Classic example of confirmation bias.  Just because you can't get a ride doesn't mean Uber is throttling your rides.  It's just that there are a million other drivers out on a slower night fighting for scraps so they can also finish their quests.I've never had an issue finishing a quest if I'm wrapping it up at a decent hour.  It only gets tricky when it gets late on a Sunday when people aren't riding much.
Last couple rides to finish a quest be crazy af….,maximagent,hnfxtqy,hnfxoz3,Yeah it was 1 am and trying to get 2 more rides without staying out all night. I selected the appropriate “no car seat” option. I 100% would do that any other time.
Last couple rides to finish a quest be crazy af….,maximagent,hnfykrw,hnfy9z8,I feel it’s easier to complete a quest by not waiting till the last day. It’s always some crazy ride on the last day of a quest.
Last couple rides to finish a quest be crazy af….,talrogsmash,hngo0m2,hnfy7lr,Yup!!
Last couple rides to finish a quest be crazy af….,CIAMom420,hnh5kih,hngqz2c,Then finish the quest earlier in the day when there are pax.  I don't understand why so many people post about trying to wrap up their quest at 2 AM on a Sunday but can't get rides and they assume Uber is throttling them.  You aren't getting rides because there aren't many at that time and you have a ton of other drivers to compete with.
Last couple rides to finish a quest be crazy af….,DFW_Panda,hnhgpim,hnh53dg,"Nope, can't agree with that.  I've completed many quests with more than 24 hours remaining on the quest clock and still the last 5 or so rides are crappy.  Long distance to pick-up, long rides out to the boonies, no shows, or re-assignments to pax who I just cancelled on b/c they were late for the pick-up."
Last couple rides to finish a quest be crazy af….,LoveSpellNova,hnh9dxc,hnh53dg,"I totally understand your point. I even left room for that possibility. 4 hours though?

Last couple rides to finish a quest be crazy af….,maximagent,hnh74ko,hnh5kih,Lady…the algo intentionally gives you the worst rides.
Last couple rides to finish a quest be crazy af….,LoveSpellNova,hnh79hp,hnh5kih,"As I said, first quest attempt. Hard lesson learned. 🤷🏾‍♀️Atlanta is not THAT dead though...  Every other Sunday into Monday has been consistent.  True story, I had a passenger who is a programmer, and he confirmed that it is simple code to put a driver in ""time out"".  Kinda like how we get booted after declining 2 or 3 rides in a row. Anywho, ya live and ya learn. 🙃"

Uber Support for the Win!! (Story Time) 💜🤑💜,LoveSpellNova,ra8rk9,0,"It's been a long run, and I thought I'd close out with the 3 for $18 promo. I made it to the zone with 10min to spare and got a ping 20min away (🙄).  The lady was kind and stated she kept getting canceled on (short trip).  She asked if we could stop at the corner store, and she'd tip cash. She was in and out, and after she unloaded her groceries, I received a $5 tip. My second ride of my 2 trip series was an airport drop off. Sweet! I wanted to go back to the airport anyway, and now I'll get to jump the queue...NOT!Before I pull off I get hit with ""take photo to verify account;"" it's the 4th or 5th time since I started yesterday. It ALWAYS does this when I'm near the end of my alotted12hrs (😒🙄). Soooo my streak?...dead! 😩On my way to the rideshare lot, I contact support, explain the issue, and advised that I still had one ride to complete.  My rep gave me the $18!! 😁💵🤸🏾‍♀️.There are over 100 assorted ride types in queue right now. That's the only thing that couldn't be remedied. I need a nap anyway. 😂 Hopefully this helps anybody else facing similar circumstances. Take a screenshot of the account verification request too. I forgot to do so, but thankfully didn't need it.TLDR: App kicked me off with 1 ride left of consecutive trip series. Support still paid the bonus. Never hurts to call.

Uber had downgrade my Bonus/Quest to Uber Eat.,feinburgrl,radyme,0,"When I started to do Uber in 2018, I was only doing Uber Eats. This year I sign up to Uberx and have been getting these pretty good quest and bonuses. 6.5$ to 18$ 3 Consecutive trips and $210 if I do 60 trips in 4 days. I have been getting these bonuses for about 3 months and keep me on Uber more over Lyft, Doordash and Grubhub. I would say 75% of my income would come from Uber just because of the bonus they gave out. Now from what I remember Uber Eats quest which I didn't know they have two different type of quest for Uberx and Eat was like $30 for 30 delivery. That really a good bonus. When I was doing Uber, 60% was Eats and 40% was X. It's really disappointed that by doing This, I will be working less on Uber and pretty much will not be doing any rideshare. I really like Lyft rideshare over Uber because it was much quicker and have little issues with customers and getting the bonus they give out. 😡😡😡That's why I didn't really like making most of my money from one app because they would change everything and I would have to refocus and learn the ways on the other apps more."

I received a message from Uber saying ""Guarantee Complete. ....we are adding $632.72 extra to your next pay statement"". But, I never received a payment. Contacted Uber. They said that account was flagged, and my payment is gone. They couldn't explain why nor they never notified me about the issue. I kept contacted Uber, through Twitter, BBB, HQ in San Francisco, etc... Uber kept telling me to wait as they are reviewing the account. I waited 17 weeks. Today, Uber messaged me saying, they won't pay my money. Still, they can't explain why. In past 17 weeks, I exchanged more than 50 messages and phone calls. Without proving any reason, Uber simply refuse to pay (just because their AI made decision). My rage right now is up to the moon now. If someone sue Uber or do something against Uber, I'm there. Let me know.This is not part of complaint on the above, but I'm really curious. Past 17 weeks, I spoke with so called Supervisors at Uber.  Why they are 100% Chinese Females?

I wasn’t aware of the glitch but I was damn sure that if I didn’t get what was owed I was going to file a complaint. And that wasn’t even close to the amount they owe you op."

Inform them in 30 days you will forward the complaint to the Attorney Generals office and the California Employment Development AND sue for treble damages in your local state court system. You demand to see any evidence of wrongdoing or be compensated.This is only if you are 100% legit and you didn't try and pull some bullshit like have a friend request a ride in your living room while you sat there watching the game and drinking beers - then ran to the store for more beer and back - they are wise to that shit and don't forget - their app is ON BOTH YOUR PHONES with permissions - location collection is part of it.Another one is refusing a 2 stop ride and turning it into into TWO RIDES - anything you might have done to boost your ride count. There are a few variables of this.They want to protect their data gathering and anti cheat procedures. They don't have to tell you anything.Are you still driving for uber now? Did you quit immediately after hitting your bonus? What is your present status?

I had one of my guys take his bucket truck he was driving to a heavy truck shop I frequently used for my small fleet of 5 trucks. They were just to do brakes, 2 front tires, and an inspection. I used this place because they were open 24 hours. You could drop the truck off at the end of a workday and get it the next morning sometimes. They ended up doing way more than I asked totaling $3600. I was expecting a bill no more than $800. I paid the bill to get the truck. I took them to court and the judge listened to both of us....it came down to his word against mine. I got half back. The owner wrote me a check in court. What sucked worse was losing the business relationship. Not having a reliable place to drop off my trucks really sucked."

Uber deliverers in Vancouver: How do you sign up for walk delivery when you don't drive,Miserable-Setting420,rafj8z,0,"I'm tearing out my hair. Long story short: A few years ago I signed up accidentally for Uber drivers. I requested support in stopping this. They deactivated my account. Fastforward 2021 and I need extra cash. I don't drive, but in Vancouver you can walk deliver. I made an account, only for it to tell me my account is deactivated. Speaking with support multiple times, I'm told I need to upload my ICBC drivers record... I've already told them I don't drive, so how is this expected. They tell me unfortunately, I still need to do this. I check out the link they sent and ICBC wants you to put in your driver's liscence number. Lol, I obviously don't have one. I haven't called ICBC yet, but I expect them to say that they can't make this up for me as I don't have a driver's liscence and would need to get it for that to happen. Has anyone had this experience with Uber? Can someone help out? I'm literally desperate for money as my contract at work has gone back to normal, 32 hours a week. I like my job, so no one suggest to find other work right now.  I just need the extra bump and want to do it on my own terms.UPDATE: It all got resolved! So far anyways. I wound up calling the US Customer service line and they reset things for me!"

Why are you thinking I will stop in a traffic lane to pick you up?,cabbiegoatenburg,hnl5b6p,hnkwqv9,"So I work as a chauffeur in NYC and have some  experience in viewing both cabs and  delivery contractors do their thing. Cabs- Cabbies in NYC own the road. They do what they want, stay on our toes. It doesn’t matter what’s going on, if a driver spots a fare, tunnel vision takes over. I had a few close calls when I first started driving the in city, as they will just stop , no warning, nothing. “Oh look a fare”- stop!  They will also load and load passengers right in the middle of the street, in crosswalks, wherever. If I’m being fair, they will try to get out of the way, but if they’re unable to, prepare to wait a minute. Delivery Contractors- I’ve noticed quite a few who usually have a passenger with them. Which is beneficial to them, as they can stand in front of fire hydrants as long as the someone’s waiting in the car. If they’re alone, hustling is the name of the game as they’ll double park and quickly deliver the package. In Manhattan, high rises and most apartment buildings have doormen, so they can drop the package at the door and go. For buildings without a door man, there might be an accessible entry way, or packages are left on stoops. The only time I’ve ever watched the same driver doing laps around the block was a woman who had quite a few deliveries on that block. She was actually quite lucky to find the spot, as quite a few streets and huge chunks of the avenues are delivery vehicle only parking during the day. And with the lull in tourism meter maids tend to come out of no where. In their defense, they will do a quick scan to see if the driver is b-lining it to them but once they grab thier computers and start the process , you’re getting a ticket, no questions asked. NYPD tow trucks, you don’t want one of those rolling through while your car is in an illegal spot. This happens a lot. Guy pulls up, parks illegally- scans for meter maid hustles to deliver and spots a pizzeria a couple doors down. He scans again and runs in thinking “I’ll only be 5 mins, there’s no one around”. That’s usually when the tow truck just appears. They’re sneaking and fast. I’ve seen one roll in, hook the car and go in 2 mins. It’s quite impressive, and expensive. You gotta love NY man Have a great day."

Why are you thinking I will stop in a traffic lane to pick you up?,Maleficent_Cash909,hnnpmow,hnmyiy3,"Yes, Its called double parking. Though fines can get hefty as its very annoying to those around particularly if one is stuck in traffic only to see the tall van in your lane abruptly throw on its hazards and having to drive around the van while no one lets you change lane this happens everyday in places like SF and Berkeley or any other dense city where curbsides are packed to the gills and drivers desperate for open parking(People might also do it spotting a parked car show any sign of leaving), But the worst is being boxed in by one in a legal parking space when in a hurry to leave. Especially if its a giant truck or bus. At least taxicabs and UPS/fedex/USPS or Amazon is normally quick about it. However would you expect your Amazon delivery to circle for parking before they could drop off your package in a high density area.Interestingly some have taken to ""parking"" in center turn lanes instead.

Why are you thinking I will stop in a traffic lane to pick you up?,cabbiegoatenburg,hnhjuwd,hng8dih,"I would imagine that market size plays a major role in it. Frankly, in my situation, mostly all of it, with a bit of luck of course. I live in southern CT, an hour from NYC. There’s nothing but human beings everywhere, with money to spend, who have no problem having dinner or a frappe delivered. I’ve definitely spent time in my share of drive-thru lines, comes with the territory, however, around 11pm, there’s only a handful of delivery spots open, and their mostly fast food. it’s not uncommon to get doubles. And after 1am, when everyone has flooded another area and switched back to giving rides, business for me picks up. Most being quick trips, often taking 20mins, from pickup to delivery. That happens regularly. Don’t be afraid to chat up other drivers, you learn a lot about their habits and little isms about them and your market. Oh, hustle! Unless pickup instructions say “don’t come in for x amount of time, I don’t care if I’m next door to an accepted ping, I’m immediately headed inside making my intentions known. You’d be surprised at how wrong Uber is with regard to timing. Also, if it isn’t ready, at least the restaurant can put a face to the order. I’ve had times when staff would say “Uber’s here, get this guy out of here”. Food service workers get it, and sometimes, will essentially cut the line for you, and all you did was walk in and say hello. Hustle!! It’s funny, I’ve pulled up to restaurants and parked next to a guy waiting on an order.  I go in, grab my order, and head out. Ironically, while grabbing my order, I notice other delivery orders sitting there waiting on a driver. It’s safe to say, while dude is in his car waiting on what he may consider a reasonable amount time, his clock is ticking away while, what  most likely is his order, sits on a shelf getting cold. Knowledge of your market and hustle, the best advice I can you. It should be noted, not all markets are like mine, obviously, so don’t be afraid to work multiple apps. All of them have regular promotions, so you’d be foolish not to take advantage of that. Also, some nights just suck, that’s the business, so it’s crucial that you take advantage of the good times, and knock on a bit of wood as you walk out the house.

Why are you thinking I will stop in a traffic lane to pick you up?,Maleficent_Cash909,hnokd6n,hnnpuw8,Its impossible to double park without blocking traffic in some way. If you have to pull along side another parked car and stay there you are double parked. And potentially boxing that poor guy in as well as forcing others to drive around you. As if its not a parking lane than its an active traffic/travel lane. Delivery drivers do this often though . Otherwise how else would deliveries be done in inner cities. But Nothing like nightmare of being boxed in by a furniture delivery van who needs to take like 15 minutes to carry furniture to the suite upstairs while  double parked in the travel lane next to the parking space. There are many treads on uber people talking about this already. Ironically some posters say they will rate their drivers down for engaging in double parking but then they had to request an Uber where there is no place to not double park except at intersections which isn't a better choice either. But I don't blame them as if parking was easy they would likely had driven themselves and we won't be having this post. And they are likely unfamiliar with the city as well.[https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/4adv86/double\_parking\_uber\_and\_lyft\_drivers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/4adv86/double_parking_uber_and_lyft_drivers/)Though I do understand if the poster meant the riders would have him leave the car double parked to search for them at lobby of a building or front door of their home not ready to leave.
Why are you thinking I will stop in a traffic lane to pick you up?,cabbiegoatenburg,hnit48p,hnih21c,"You said everything is spread out. Have a look at google maps, get an idea of high density population areas and restaurants that are available to those areas, as well as where affluent neighborhoods start and urban centers end. For instance- Thursday-Sunday I try and stay in the affluent sections, bringing dinner to families who don’t feel like cooking. While the frequency of deliveries aren’t as high, the payouts more than make up for it. They’re also more inclined to tip. After dinner rush I slowly make my way back toward more high density areas. Something to think about. If the delivery seems a little far to drive, consider where you are once the delivery is complete. You could be inadvertently limiting your revenue for the night by avoiding a longer than normal drive, a drive that would put you in a potentially busy area. You really never know till you try, or because you’ve done a bit of research, you know that every chain restaurant is there, and there’s a college nearby. Stay safe out there, and you’re welcome."

"Uber drivers of Orlando, how is it out there? How often do you wait before your next pickup? Starting out by using hyrecar, so was wondering about what I can expect to make in a full days work.",ukfan758,hnispd1,raffue,"Terrible. Rates are 53.7 cents a mile and 8.84 cents a minute plus just 75 cents base, the lowest in the nation. Even with awful rates tons of people still drive because 95% of the jobs in Orlando are service/tourism that pay under $20 an hour so they need something to supplement their income. Surges are somewhat rare with the only ones happening are downtown on weekends at closing time (where most of the roads are closed and it'll take 30 minutes to get to and from there which makes it worthless). The airport at around midnight-1am will have surges but those disappear in 5 minutes as 100 idiots chase the surge and then sit there for 2 hours even though the next flight isn't until 6 am. There's some other times and areas but I'm sure drivers that know about them here would prefer to keeps those a secret lol. The biggest issue is that Orlando is too spread out which means you'll be destroying your car from the tons of miles all while operating at a loss with the terrible pay. Plus every freeway beside I-4 is a toll road and the surface streets have horrendously timed lights. Don't do Uber here.Edit: The only advantage I would say is that requests are very consistent (i.e. you won't sit in a parking lot getting 0 requests for an hour), it's just that you get paid virtually nothing."

Too many drivers,GayJewishMuslim,r9ypvf,0,"I've seen posts about drivers wanting to buy nice or new cars for uber. Pay around here in Richmond has dropped by about 50% and I've already waited an hour for a ride. Luckily this is just part time job for me and as I've observed so many drivers are willing to stay ""clocked in"" for less than 9 or 10 an hour. My one ride since I started this hour was for 4 dollars. Uber map has shown a steady 4 drivers in my immediate areas unless I go to suburbs where everyone except sketches have vehicles. Anyway, I knew this would happen quickly. Please don't buy more car than you need. Please consider that 2 or 3 weeks of good money does not mean you should quit your day job or buy a depreciating asset in inflationary times for a job that will consistently make you less money and likely cost you more to operate"

Most business trips will pick back up again early January. Peoe do travel more during the holidays but it's a short window. People aren't traveling all month for both months they usually pick one holiday or the other and travel right around that holiday.People are working less due to the holidays as well as maybe they're sick of their jobs.Finally the new omni variant probably plays a slight role in the dip in riders as well.I think come January Dallas will be booming again.

Well, 20 was the highest I achieved. But that's fine, shady but I get it. My question is this: if I choose the lowest quest of 10 trips and complete 70, would I get paid out for the 10 or the 70?"
Quest Verification,DDLyftUber,hnhym7a,rafxu5,"It’s not at all shady lmao. It’s very simple to understand and is clearly outlined that when you choose a quest, your maximum or minimum number of trips and bonus is the one that you chose.

Can riders request me personally?,jryan8064,hnhanij,hnh2njk,"I’ve never understood why both Uber and Lyft have never implemented a “preferred driver” option across the board.  If a rider likes me as a driver and wants to be able to request me specifically in the future (and I agree to it), why shouldn’t they be able to?  It wouldn’t be difficult to implement.  Just a list of favorite drivers and how far away they are (taking into account how much time is left if they are currently on an active ride).  By not doing this, they are just pushing people towards off-app arrangements, which isn’t ideal.Edit:  Just to be clear, I have had many riders ask if they could get me as a driver again, and I’ve always told them unfortunately no.  Mostly because I don’t want to give out my cell phone number, and I’m also not comfortable with the insurance issues if there were to be an accident."
Can riders request me personally?,PapaMurphy2000,hnheqxc,hnhanij,"There is a driver in my city that has her phone number on the sides of her car. Which I always think is probably not a good idea, especially for a woman."
Can riders request me personally?,Snoo74401,hnjfao3,hnhanij,"The probability of you being close to the passenger at nearly the same time they want a ride is fairly low. Especially in larger cities.Even if a passenger specifically requests you, it's very unlikely you'd take the ride because you'd probably have to drive way more than 10 minutes to pick them up.I had a passenger ""favorite"" me (I think) and then I got an app notice a few days later for a reservation from approximately their hotel to the airport. Which would have been great. If I lived near their hotel. Or was planning on driving that day."
Can riders request me personally?,jryan8064,hni9e81,hnheqxc,"Yeah, that sounds like a bad idea to me.  I suppose it could be a google voice number, or some other way to provide a layer of protection, but I don’t think I’d go that route.  Also, taking cash rides (off platform) is illegal in some cities, so I’m not sure I’d want to advertise that.  Not to mention your insurance company would probably deny your claim if they found out you were taking paying customers off app."

Can riders request me personally?,PapaMurphy2000,hnio5z6,hni9e81,Yeah the insurance piece if why I would never do it. That $20 you're making off the books vs a potential $1M lawsuit if you get into an accident that your insurance will not cover......not worth the risk for me.
Can riders request me personally?,Snoo74401,hnjfhi9,hni9e81,"As long as they're registered as private, for-hire transportation and have the proper insurance and licenses (if necessary), it's not a big deal. They're using Uber to drum up business. On the other hand, unless they're driving a limo, that's highly unlikely."
Can riders request me personally?,jryan8064,hnjgri9,hnjfhi9,"Exactly.  It is possible, but commercial insurance alone is super expensive, then you have licensing costs.  I have seen limo companies in town driving Uber when they don’t have reservations (mostly black SUVs), so I guess that’s an exception."
