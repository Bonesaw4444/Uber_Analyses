Pickup location at CVG misleading,acerodney,Pickuplocati,0,"About two weeks ago, the pickup location for Rideshare passengers arriving at CVG Airport was changed in Google Maps to read “Baggage Claim, Zone 1” from the original and equally ambiguous “Door 10”. I’m a Lyft driver (no, I don’t drive for Uber, too) and I’m constantly having to contact my airport passengers to tell them how to get to the actual pickup spot at CVG. I’ve reached out to the Airport Board numerous times to ask for better signage in the baggage claim area and to correct the wording in Google Maps but nobody ever does anything. I’m assuming it’s up to the airport authorities to officialize these wording changes since they’re specific to the given property or business. At any rate, the pickup location as shown in Google Maps in the Lyft app is causing much confusion at CVG!"
"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",StuffinMuffin,Themoreyouus,0,"I figured this would be the case.  With the introduction of upfront pricing, Uber can charge customers anything they want.  They will ask for any amount riders are willing to pay.  I have heard cases where during the hours when the business users are out, the overall fare goes up.  Trips to and from airports? You guessed it.  It'll go up because people are willing to pay.All the cheap Uber fares that we have gotten accustomed to are about to go out the window.  Regulators and law makers who shoved the taxis out.  Are you happy now?  What about those Uber fans who said, ""Uber is better and cheaper.  Screw the taxis.  Stronger survives.""  So irresponsible.  Here's the proof:""Uber appears to have the opposite of a rewards program. That is, it appears the more you use Uber as a passenger, the more they’re going to charge you per mile. Weknow Uber said they were going to experimenton charging different customers different rate, based on a variety of unpublished factors. My current belief is the more you use the service in a way that suggests you can afford more, the more they will charge you.""https://therideshareguy.com/uber-is-ripping-off-frequent-riders-and-heres-how-to-avoid-it/"
"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",LavishHaze,20047,Themoreyouus,Uber is such a shitty company. I’ve spent more on Uber than than my actual travel. One time it was around the time 5pm and normally my fare is aboit $50 and suddenly it jumped to $170. That’s a huge jump then I waited 5-10 minutes then it went to $80 and then back at $50. What kind of bullshit is that? That is more than double my original fair?  That’s 350% more. Wtf! There excuse of more in demand is such bullshit because if I wait 5 min the price changes. It’s just to see if people are willing to pay high in panic of pretending as if the customer won’t get a Uber in time. It’s no different than online shopping and then say “12 people have this in their cart” or “this item is about to sell out” wait the 5-10 minutes and you’ll see how the price goes down. Uber knows what they’re doing.

"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets.

They dominate the market now.Uber's taxi takeover has been completed successfully.  Congratulations!!!!"
"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",scotchyscotchyscotch,3186,3139,This is an age-old tactic. Predatory pricing. It was especially effective in this case since the taxis couldn't even try to compete since their pricing is regulated.If you ask me the local governments screwed this up. They should have regulated Uber when they had the chance. The cat's out of the bag now.

"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets.

"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",SmittenKitten,3207,3181,"The reason the taxi industry couldn't respond was that they aren't centrally owned or managed.  It was all distributed and locally regulated.  There were some strong entities and large unions like NYC/TLC, Pittsburgh, and mega-taxi companies in Chicago, but they were not able to respond, build a technology stack/platform, and have the large enough influence like Uber could.Uber was also working on a leverage and had access to billions of dollars (to spend on lobbyists, etc.) while the taxi companies were working for a profit, and a thin one at that."

"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",AsStibelDude,18876,18818,"Haven't you heard? Uber can charge whatever they want now.Basically, Uber charges whatever the rider is willing to pay.It isn't based on time and distance anymore.Uber quietly has updated their official pricing policy, and they updated their websites and disclaimers too.Do you know what's really messed up? The drivers aren't even told how much the rides are, and they are only paid a negotiated rate based on time and distance.  So they get paid the same amount regardless of what the riders are paying. It's not a percentage anymore."

I don't know what the hell happened but it used to be so easy and so affordable. Now its unbelievable complicated and the prices are fuckin out rageous. I needed to go just 5 mins down the street by car to the grocery store. Uber was trying to charge me $25-30!?!?! The item I needed to get from the store was only $6!!! That is fuckin insane.
"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",DDominico69,18875,18587,"Now that Uber has successfully taken over the taxi industry and forced most existing companies to bankruptcy, it's time for them to raise their prices. Their goal (that everyone knew) has always been to grab the monopoly.Not to mention the economics of taxis have never been a highly profitable business. Uber disrupted an industry that was already established, with drivers and dispatchers. It was alreday working with very low margin.  They removed it, and replaced it. It was basically just a deregulation.The problem is they added more bureaucracy to this where the company takes a huge cut (over 28%) of every ride even though they claimed to have created efficiency. We are all now facing the reality that the prices have to be raised to pre-Uber levels. Oh, you will see."
"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",JudgeItoh,3136,Themoreyouus,"yeaha, that whole upfront pricing bit was spun as something nice and noble for users who wanted to know about the fare beforehand.  but the truth was that Uber wanted to charge more money and not base it on publicly posted fares.This is much closer to getting quotes from Limos companies.and it's worse because Uber will charge you whatever they want to.  whatever you are willing to pay.  and it'll be different betweeen personal and business travelers, rich and poor, affluent neighborhood to poorer neighborhood, time of day, etc."

"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",otisburg10,18072,Themoreyouus,Taxis are under municipal price control. Uber is not. Uber is known for surge pricing. Uber is known for being dishonest. What do you think Uber will do once all their competition is driven to the ground? They will probably charge at least $20 per mile and many people will be sorry they ever supported those fascist pricks.
"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",HuhnHuhn,3067,Themoreyouus,"Right.  They can charge anything they want, which means no more deals.  Someone told me about the example of trips between Heathrow and London.

Since Uber won't give you details of trip; but, does assign you as closest to the call, Uber should then compensate you for going to where ever they are sending you. Whether the victim of a cancellation after driving 20 minutes to the pickup point, or the pickup is a two miles to the store ride. So the compensation should be two part. Drivers original location to pickup point and then pickup point to destination. If the driver reaches the pickup point, they are guaranteed compensation for that leg, no matter the outcome of the ride. Whether Uber wants to eat that addition to the drivers income or pass it on to the consumer, is up to them.If Uber assigns a ride that makes someone drive twenty minnutes to complete the task on Uber's behalf, then it is only right that they cover that cost of getting there.I think Uber should reduce it's take from the drivers money to a strict 15% of gross revenue and look for alternative revenue streams to make up the difference. For example the Unlimited 25% Club. Pay an annual membership of $49.99 and get a flat 25% off all your Uber rides. Use as many times as you like during the membership period.

Thus the company sets the rate of the ""gate"" fee the drivers pay to take out a car and in exchange they are only responsible for paying for gas while they use the car.No one gets rich in the taxi business, least of all any drivers, even those who own medallions which allow them to rent their car to another driver and for them to drive without paying the full ""gate"", the price to take out a car. Those drivers still pay a modest fee to the company for the use of the company color scheme painted on the car as well as access to the dispatcher.An Uber driver, by comparison is responsible for all costs and pays Uber a commission for access to the ""dispatch"" system, which is fully automated by computer and accessed only through a smart phone.If I had absolute power I would merge all the taxi companies into Uber, deal with the city authorities in a non adversarial manner and provide a service that was superior to the original taxi cab services and paid the drivers better than the current Uber model does.However, in order to do that, they would have to create a better incentive for drivers to stay out all night long, perhaps by accepting a much lower commission from drivers between the hours of 3AM and 6AM in order to keep cars on the road.The prices as they are today should probably rise by 50%-75% in order to be fair to the drivers as well as all the investors waiting to recoup the money they gave Uber to start up.Read less..."

They instead took the selfish take-over route, where they went head-on, and tried to own the industry.Some people argue that taxi companies wouldn't have played the game and that they would have slow down the growth of Uber. However, Grab, Ola, Didi, 99 and Meru are all doing great jobs at merging with local taxi companies.  Sure, there are hiccups, disputes, and people clashing, but as a result, they have grown quickly and established roots in massive markets.  Uber?  not so much.So what's next?  Will there be an implosion with where the fare stands today?  Will there be a reckoning day?   ...or will Autonomous Vehicles save the day by eliminating the driver pay?  Will the consumers take the blunt by paying more tips?  Will Didi and Ola take over the North American market by merging taxi companies (including Flywheel and Cubr) and bring down Uber/Lyft?What an exciting time to be alive.Read less..."

I quickly quit doing that unless there was a surge.Similar analysis of driving my Prius revealed that the grand total of my net, after-cost earnings over 4 months to be about $6 / hour even though I had originally thought I was making almost $14 / hour after incentives.  Yes - factoring in costs, I made less than minimum wage.So in essence, Uber and Lyft were exploiting my ignorance of what my true costs were going to be.  That's why I say that the business models of both companies are unsustainable. Both companies are betting on driverless vehicles rescuing them from the low fare prices they're charging riders - but I don't think they can keep finding new drivers to replace their former drivers (like me) forever.There will be a day of reckoning, and if I were CEO, I'd be worried that it might come sooner than later and before autonomous vehicles arrive.  So that would be my top priority.Read less..."

Raise the rates!Back to the levels of regular taxis.Depend on the Technology: The Uber's app experience has been game changing, and people loved it for the convenience, simplicity, and the safety it promoted.  That itself is an incentive for people to use it.  Why did they ever slash rates?Competitors?  No problem!Lyft and other rideshare companies are barely keeping up and pegging their rates on Uber.  If Uber raised the rates, they will too.  No need to worry about the competition.Become profitable: Taxis were localized annd profitable.  Bring the prices up to its previous levels, and Uber can immediately solveHappy drivers? Worried about driver retention?  All the complaints you hear about from drivers are the rates.  All the fiasco about transparencies, hours, employees/contractors, safety, etc. etc. etc.?  They will all be solved once the rates are raised and drivers start making good money."

Once they do, they just have to hold on a little longer to drive the sword all the way in...

No longer accepting idiots who try to do UberX or UberPOOL with a Mercedes C300 and then complain about the costs to drive! Higher pay and lower costs result in an actual profitable business. From there, I work to expand the business from a healthier footing.This would probably be very unpopular with investors and affect the valuation of the company in a negative way, since this strategy ultimately pulls back from the goal of making transportation “flow like water” to everybody and it hurts the network effects of having an almost unlimited supply of cars and drivers on the platform.I would combat that though with a heavy focus on Jump, a dockless pedal-assisted bikeshare company that Uber recently acquired. These bikes (and similar products) would be a the future in making transportation and mobility accessible to everyone. In the long term, the bikes would likely be a lot cheaper than drivers and offer a higher profit margin by taking the driver and their expensive car out of the equation. As a driver myself, I would be glad to pass off these short-distance, minimum fare rides to the bikes. I would also continue investing heavily in autonomous vehicles because that’s just the future.That’s pretty simple to say online. I guess that’s why I’m not the CEO of anythingRead less..."

So the company isn't even making the money, and that's probably why they feel justified to pay the drivers too little.but I agree with you.  Rideshares is just a commodity.  It's the drivers and their cars are the ASSET and create REVENUE.   (This reminds me of a consulting company where the company is nothing but a shell.)   So without drivers there'd be nothing.  Again, it's a commodity.  If all drivers got up and decided to move over to another company with a separate software, they can.  In a single day.  Leaving Uber in the dust.Uber should just be a software platform that connects people P2P-style.  Just let it be a software that people can download for a few bucks.  Like Napster and Torrents.  True Peer-to-Peer.  Is that too much to ask?"

Neither one of them will be able to realize their dreams by participating in bottom fishing. The mindset is fairly typical of most technology companies make a lot of noise lose money for 6 to 10 years go public Game over. Lower rates is a badd idea. Competition should breed better outcome for everyone drivers and passengers problem is both companies are chickenshit and trying to force each other out of the business. They can CO exist like taxi companies have CO existed forever in cities all over the world. But these guys don't get it yet. The root of the problem is simple they are truly technology companies they're not in the transportation business with the right spirit of providing good point to point transportation for the passengers and the ability for the drivers to make a decent living. They see it as how to make a better app and more money for themselves and to the  soon to be pubic stockholders.  What should happen and I hope that it's in the very near future is both of these companies would have the balls to raise the dam rates. Stop being concern about the bottom feeders the cheapskates is looking for a free ride. Provide a system that gives safe rides at a fair price should be the focus. However they don't see that as an option right now they are trying to tread water to get to the point when they can eliminate drivers altogether. Keep in mind they see themselves as a technology company 1st period.  Developing new technology to eliminate the way the transportation system works to get people from point A to point B. The ripple from this affects a lot of other companies and industries in a negative way. I recently read an article about how the parking lot company's are losing money  because people are not driving to go to bars and restaurants and entertainment events the way they used to. Valet parking has also been impacted.  I would guess the alcohol  Industry is doing quite well. The taxi cab companies are feeling the impact but at the same time ride share companies have picked up the low life scum bag bottom fishers as customers because of cheap rates.I'm a driver based out of Los Angeles I drive a 2018 luxury SUV.  I never do pools I will only do an UberX or Lyft  If there is a 2.0  Surge for higher in that location.  The rates for Uber XL and Lyft XL are also too low.Read less...

What's a typical passenger rating for Uber? Is 4.50 good?,"ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLC",ippei1202Ube,What'satypic,"Depends on location. Also depends on UberX or UberBlack.The average passenger ratings are different from city to city.  With that said, most drivers feel the average passenger rating is about 4.6. Perhaps we will venture a guess with this scale:Around 4.70~4.90 is good.Between 4.50~4.60 is acceptableBelow 4.50 requires some caution.We have heard from drivers that they do not pick up passengers below 4.80 when it's busy or at airports where, once you are at the top of the queue, a request is guranteed. Furthermore, there seems to be a wide consensus among drivers that they won't pick up anyone below 4.50.For drivers, they average 4.7~4.80, and if they are 4.60 or below, they are in risk of being deactivated.  You rarely see above 4.90, unless you are in smaller cities.Any comments from the drivers?(UPDATE 2018/10/15: Adjusted the scale slightly and inserted a blurb on what ratings drivers would consider declining the requests.)ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Oct 15, 2018"

But please, wait until you're really READY to depart before requesting a driver and have your shoes on and be ready to go when we arrive.  Remember, WE MAKE NOTHING waiting for you, or driving to pick you up.  NOTHING!!!  So please be considerate!!!12.  Lastly, please don't eat Taco's and messy foods in the car.  I know you think you're starving and that drive through Taco Bell stop smells SO good.  But please - it is totally wrong to expect us to stop and clean our car in preparation for the next passenger (who is probably already waiting for us to arrive) to clean up YOUR mess.  That will ALWAYS result in a lower rating.13.  Lastly, be considerate.  Leave the car in better shape than when you arrived.  We are NOT responsbile for your trash, your chewing gum wrappers, your candy papers, and I can ASSURE you the next passenger doesn't want to see them.Read less..."

But you can bring the points up by tipping driver's in cash for several rides until your score goes up. This is just a quick tip to get the ratings up, as by tipping in cash automatically gets you 5 stars, since driver will have no doubt whether you will or will not tip (through the app) = remove all doubt. You do not have to tip much, perhaps $1.00 per every 5 minutes in the car, and of course round up if you feel generous:)"

You arrive at destination driver swipes end trip & wants to move on but the rating pops up & we cant get go any further in the app until we rate. If they ard busy and trying to rush maybe they accidentally hit 1 stat or 3 stars instead of 5. Uber WILL NOT change a rating no matter what you tell them for driver or rider. Maybe driver hates rating system so he just clicks whatever to get passed that screen. Not saying its fair but maybe these are reasons. Lyft gives driver 24 hrs to rate rider. Uber gives 5 secs.  Rider gets 2/3 weeks on Uber and not sure on Lyft but its at least 24hrs.Here is another senario. I am not being sarcastic or rude but here is a possibility your rating is not 5 stars. You state "" I am tired, work hard, long hrs, you TRY to be FRIENDLY companion if I MUST"".  ""Really would like to rest, catch up on work, but long ago I  REALIZED they WONT let me I listen and reply in as FRIENDLY WAY AS I CAN"".   I get it yes sometimes its nice to have a conversation with your rider but you worked your long day you are tired you may want peace and quiet. Totally understandable. I cant agree more after you worked all day who wants to hear other peoples problems. I totally agree i would do the same be nice, listen, agree (no driver should be sharing their problems, difficulties, or issues with you, they should keep conversation light, upbeat, and positive). Common sense to most but not all. I capitalized negatives to point out that you MAY enter car with a negative vibe because it seems you get those drivers that unload their problems on you. Its just going to be one of those rides you dread. You are kind enough to listen, show compassion, and try to be friendly. But in reality you want peace and quiet and to be left alone.  That is your right and no one should tell you your rude. It could be possible tbat a few drivers are picking up that you are just going along & being nice because you have to.  Even though you think & feel you are handling these types of drivers wonderfully they may see through it. They also may feel it is fake and your just being condescending. When in fact you feel you are being nice, polite, and friendly. Again not saying you are fake, not saying you should have to change or talk to driver the whole ride. If I have a bad rider and immediately pick another rider up I may smile, i may talk, i may say all the right things but there are times i can feel some awkwardness, negativity in the car becausd of previous rider. Once I realize this I have to let go of the negativity and the anger from previous rider or this will continue after each and every rider. Some people are more sensitive than others and can feel negative energy, vibes, presence, auora whatever you want to call it. Agsin not trying to be rude.Try this next time. Get in the car smile, say good morning, how are you. Driver says my back is killing me, Uber dont listen to its dtivers, my husband is  lazy blah blah blah. Respond with sorry i hope things get better for you I had a rough day also i had to bring my work home with  me so if you will excuse me I have emails i have to answer, vm to listen to, texts to get out or I may just nod off for an hour. At end of ride simply say thank you for giving me quiet time I accomplished a lot or the nap really helped. That should shut that type of driver down and now you can do whatever and not have deal with that type of driver shut it down from beginning. If uncomfortable text driver "" good morning i have a ton of work to catch up on or need a nap i would appreciate the quiet  time. These 2 things can prevent you from having to fake wanting to talk or listen to their problems  sorry couldnt think of another way to phrase it:)  See if it helps it cant hurt. Headphones are great. Get in and say i had a rough day going to stick headphones on and take a nsp or relax. Driver knows you are occupied and comfortable they can concentrate on the roadI think their should be icons you can click ahead of time if you want ex.

Drivers are independent contractors, think of us like plumbers. If  I fixed your faucet one time and you were rude, next time you called me I would not service you (despite your offer to pay me).Drivers are not signing up to drive to drive rude passengers either, but often we are indeed doing just that.

By driver rating him that at least gives other drivers a heads up that you may be getting yourself into a really annoying problem some ride. Uber will not deactivate riders although they claim the riders can be. So at least drivers can warn other drivers."

If you do 20 rides or more per day and everyone slams your door (most people do close the door harder than it needs to be) its wear and tear and eventually something may come loose or break. An easy way to prevent slamming doors is for driver to get out open and close door for passenger.

What's a typical passenger rating for Uber? Is 4.50 good?,momof4,8772,8758,"I get why drivers get annoyed because it is wear and tear on door, the window, door locks, etc. Those things are all in the door panel that can come lose or break. I also understand the passengers point of view. When I took my 1st ride what did I do? Slammed the door. Not intentionally. It's impossible to know how much force you need to shut every door on every car out there.My only advice is DRIVER: open door for your passengers and close it.RIDER: if you know that drivers are getting annoyed                                   try to close doors with less force. It can be costly                                       for driver to repair or replace."

I always rating those kind of the nice humble riders 5 stars if they are friendly and socialize with a sense of hummer  by joking and  having a small chatting with the riders trying not ignoring them if they want to talk which make me fill having good time doing my job keeping entertained getting treated as a spacial super star which make me so excited and also keeping our vehicle clean with no mess or damages  or eating and drinking inside making a mess  .if the riders do not engage in conversations I will down rate them with 2 to 3 stars maximum for being formal ,rude and jerks with arrogant behavior acting like they are bossy treating the drivers as a slave especially if they jumped to my car asking me to take them to their destination  without saying ""Hello"" and also if they are not talkative being so quite during the trip entertaining themselves by  texting or talking on the cell or people and also if they are talking among to each other with people inside my car ignoring me instead of chatting with me which is really awkward and super rude ,getting frustrating and makes me feel like a machine doing my job which not nice at all to be rude and disrespectful with no reason and make me feel uncomfortable  .Those kind of riders need to understand Uber is a community service not like a taxi cab service taking them from point A to B  making a space between the riders and drivers.Also it's very annoying ,super awkward and very rude for being quite not chatty or chatting among to each other keep the driver ignored and also when they ask the driver turning on the radio very loud beside ignoring the drivers chatting among to each other so that they deserve 2 stars for misbehave with no respect for the friendly Uber drivers and their vehicle . So if the riders want to be a good 5 star rating passenger they need to make that "" Don't Ignore your friendly Uber driver "". If the riders are looking for a quite service with a quite formal driver without being sociable and friendly avoiding getting a bad star rating for being formal with a drivers all the time during the trip taking them only from point A to point B just to have a relaxation doing their own privacy by making a space or a wall between the drivers not communicating with them without a friendly atmosphere such as : listening to the music or playing a video on the cell phone and also texting or talking on the phone without an excuse or doing their own entertainment by chatting among to each other ....etc ,it's much better to take a public transport up such as a taxi cab , shuttle , bus or luminous with those formal quite drivers . However ;those cab drivers are unfriendly with their passenger , busy and making a space always who are not talkative with there passenger as long they are looking for a quite and relaxation service like that and also they don't have any friendly greeting their riders like us as an Uber's partners.However;If those arrogant riders ignoring us as a friendly drivers like to have a quite ride with your phone texting ,talking and chatting with people with you keeping the uber driver ignored by treating us as a server or slave its will be better for them to take a public transport up such as a taxi cab , shuttle , bus or luminous which is fair enough if they don't show us any friendly treatment with a respect as a human being. That's what riders need with a mutual respect to be nicer and friendly and to treat the driver with courtesy say"" hello,how are you"" . Some of the driver love having a small talk with their riders and many of the drivers don't like a quite riders which make them feel uncomfortable .However; if the rider would like to be chatty with a driver or not It's optional they don't always have to if the rider want a quite ride , but still riders need be more respectful if they don't want to be removing poorly rated passengers drops below 4.0  from the app .Be a good friendly Uber rider with your driver please !!!!!Read less..."

I have told one or two drivers that were doing a horribly bad job that they were doing a bad job, though. If it's not okay to complain to bad drivers, then, maybe it's time to go back to taxis. What always blows my mind is the number of bad drivers who have ""diamond"" ratings. Also, there's no way for me to complain to Uber when, say, a driver refuses to pick me up at an Express Pool spot that the app made me go to, or cancels a ride a minute before pickup."

Lowest I had ever seen on a great passenger was 4.56. He was from Mexico city and his two friends laughed and laughed when I told him. They (like most passengers) had no idea. Lots of drivers downrate people for reasons other than behavior (race, religion, no tip etc). Whatever, I had an older couple that were 4.3 but a sheduled ride (see airport) so I took it. They were fine, polite, tipped but hsd no idea how to operate the app, or protocol for requsts, where to stand etc. Concierge ordered their ride in advance, some drivers don't like old people or are very impatient.

I've only every had 6 rides, 4 to and from airport, 1 short trip with 6 friends where we split and 1 Saturday night from a club (which was my first). So the 4 airports were from what I remember all pretty easy going, didn't talk with drivers as they didn't want to talk, 2 were from a Gatwick hotel to the airport itself and the other 2 in Basel, we put our own bags in the boot of the car. The late night trip was a 40min cross London trip, we were tired so we weren't loud and we didn't have food with us (pick up was a gay bar, so that may be a factor). Being from the UK and especially not being from London, I tend not to tip, although it seems I really should be, even though it's not in our culture per se, I've worked in the service industry, we don't expect tips here, they are just a bonus if you do. I just wonder if I can ever improve it, I guess with only 6 trips if I pull my finger out and get a few 5 ratings it should improve quickly."

So after 15 of min of no further response after she drove off (had already waited 10 min before she arrived and pulled her ""you're not my fare act) I finally cancelled. I think she pretended I wasn't her fare as she had a very small car and I would have had to put a couple things on her back seat, and in fact she didn't make her claim til I started asking if that was ok.Stupid thing is... the next words out of my mouth would have been ""and I have a towel to put under them to make sure your seat doesn't get dirty"" (not that my bags are dirty, but just in case). And, that's also why I tip well- or at least I thought 45-50% cash tip (with a $5 min) was at least decent, esp considering otherwise I am a model passenger - as I know it takes an extra few minutes to put my stuff in the car and time = $.So wtf am I doing wrong, or could the low rating be just from that one driver? I did report what she did to Uber as that was a lot of bullshit - if she didn't want to drive me she should have cancelled herself, or at least messaged me and pretended she couldn't get to me or some lie that at least would have prevented me from standing there for another 15 min after a 15 hour work day.Btw, I also always give drivers a 5.0 rating, except that one chick. And as I live in a big tourist town and often get off work around 2am, the low rating does hurt me, as there are always a ton of drunk people requesting rides at that hour so I'm sure drivers think the rating means I must be one of them.... when in reality I am anything but! So what exactly is the point of being super considerate and giving good cash tips if I'm not going to be rated accordingly?Read less..."

A week later he claimed we spilled coffee in his car and we were charged a cleaning fee. None of us had any coffee which can be confirmed by concierge at the hotel. The most frustrating thing of all this is just being able to reach Uber easily I guess. I feel like this driver is harassing us even after the ride.

I think it would also reflect in his ratings.  I will elaborate on that in another thread later today as I am on my way out. I have a theory about that and would like to run it by other drivers. If you have time please check it out and let me know what you think. I should have it up by no later than 3am. Ride guru forum a lot more respectful and helpful drivers.Read less...

Can I drive someone else's car for Uber? (or Can my friend drive my car for ...,"ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLC",ippei1202Ube,CanIdrivesom,"The answer is ""yes"", but there are caveats.Yes, your friend, family member, or anyone else can drive your car for Uber, but with a few caveats:- The person meets the Uber requirements to become a driver, e.g. over 21, legally licensed, etc.- The person needs to be properly insured and ""attached to the vehicle.""Yes, the ""attached"" is a bit ambiguous, but I used that term loosely because the law on how insurance works is different from state to state (in the USA). In most states, your friend's name only has to be listed on the vehicle's insurance policy. In some states, especially where the insurance follows the driver (rather than car), Uber seems to require your friend's name to be listed on the registration as well.On a side note: this is a growing problem for the rideshare industry, where Uber drivers either let other people drive to take maximum advantage of the car OR they sign up under one vehicle and drive someone else's cars, etc. a rental.ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Aug 15, 2021"

(This is your dad's Uber account?) Even if he is with you, you technically shouldn't be driving!This is due to the insurance that's in play.  While you are delivering food, you would be under Uber's insurance.  If you get into an accident, the insurance company will know who was driving and will likely deny the claim.  What's worse is that your car insurance will likely deny it too, because technically you were working for Uber and Uber should be providing the coverage.  I'd hate for you to be in such a scenario."

Got a request and figured it will be good to pick up the passenger to reduce deadheaded miles. Picked him up, started the trip and noticed that his ultimate destination was indeed close to my house, BUT he also had a stop planted 40 minutes away, prior to the drop off, so that would add an hour and half to my trip. Strange that Lyft would match us up where I clearly entered my destination (they can't assume I will be willing to drive around for anohter 1.5 hours prior to drop off).

I dont disagree with anyone even when I dont agree. I talk when my rider wants conversation and shut up when I know they dont. I try to let them pick the conversation and where it goes.  I use ratings as a guide. Unfortunately some lower rated riders were absolutely no problem and they tipped. That leaves me to believe the other drivers were the problem not the rider. It does suck at times going by the ratings.  I've taken chances at times that have paid off but I've also declined rides based on ratings that could've also been fine.

"As a driver, have you kicked out a passenger?

I dont do a lot of bar rides anymore but when I do their rating needs to be 4.80 or higher. Rides during the day depending on the area I will go as low as 4.65. I have done a 4.50 rider who liked to give directions but other than that was very nice and tipped 20% on long ride. I had a 4.52 the other night I posted in comments below that I shouldnt of accepted. Lyft is useless everyone is 4.9 or 5 stars. On the few occassions I see a 4.8 I dont accept. Thats a low rating on Lyft. lolI just want to add when you pull up make sure your doors are locked. Ask who they are and who their driver is. It gives you 10/15 secs to check out their demeanor, attitude, & possibly how intoxicated they are. I sometimes say ""sorry didnt realize doors were locked"" if they seem annoyed (diesn't happen often). If I am not sure but suspect an issue I will talk to them and fiddle around with my phone (another 10/15 secs) blaming the app before I start trip. In that time you can usually predict if there will be an issue. 2500+ rides havent kicked anyone out (2 deserved it)."

Kept asking me what the big deal was. When they complained about their safety, I decided to stay with them until another ride could arrive.  For some reason I was naive enough to think they'd call their parents or friends, but, of course, they called another Lyft.  I had already told them of the company policy and no driver would give them a ride, but they did it anyway.I felt at that point, it was not my business, so I waited until another driver arrived.

I pulled over & asked them to get out. They refused. I called 911 on speaker to report them tresspassing. They didn't wait around.I've also ended several trips when stops exceeded 5 min. Stops are intended to pickup and drop off additional riders, not to run errands or order food. I do not usually agree to stops (unless its slow) and when I do I usually remind them to ""make sure they have everything because I'll need to end the trip and move on if they're gone more than a few minutes."""

I knew I was taking a risk on getting paid correct fare & tolls.First thought was I cant dump this young girl out in the middle of no where, in the middle of the night, in this part of pitch black NJ in the pouring rain (they cant afford street lights there:)  I knew she was fully aware of what she was doing and planned the whole thing figuring the driver would take the cash. After seeing her rating I am sure she pulls this all the time. Her destination was NY 40.90 are added to the fare for tolls and a 20.00 surcharge for driver if they are not a NY driver. A NY trip usually runs a rider over 100.00 on a 45/60 min ride.Second thought was she could tell Uber I picked up wrong rider, I got lost, i was intoxicated or any other BS she could come up with along with a 1 star so she could get her $ back. My ratings could take the hit but what about a false report that could get me deactivated? My motherly side and conscience won. I took her and hoped for the best. However I needed to try and say or do something to ensure she wouldn't try to send a false report to Uber.My Turn to BS My RiderMe - Since there are so many issues with drivers assaulting riders & doing bad things Uber will contact me after I drop you off.  They will ask why I dropped you off so far from your destination. I'll explain what happened but I'll tell them you made a mistake. I wont tell them you purposely put in wrong address because you didnt have enough $ in your account to pay for an Uber. That you offered me cash for the rest of the ride. You would get deactivated.  Then I lied even more. Uber could report you to your bank for Knowingly ordering a service & not having the funds in there (it's like writing a bad check). Figured at her age she wouldnt know much about checks. I can back all that up with the video and audio I have from my dashcam. I'll just edit the beginning part out so they dont know what you really did. Good thing our whole conversation and interaction is on my dashcam so I can just upload it to Uber if needed.Rider - Thank you so much I really appreciate it.Who knows maybe she didnt believe my BS. I just wanted her to know that if she tried I had everything recorded. I did nothing wrong this was all on her and I had proof. Although Uber dont always care. Yes I did take a big chance but again I just couldnt leave her on the side of the road. It was a situation that never happened to me. If this were to happen again I would probably find a spot to let her out safely.  I did get my full fare for the miles, time, correct Bridge toll, NJ TP toll, and the additional $20 surcharge because I am a PA driver(out of state), cant pick up in NY, & tolls we occur on way back. That time of morning I take the no toll way back as there is no traffic & puts me back in the area where its busy, where I want to be accepting more long trips.  So 27 months haven't thrown anyone out. Just 2 close calls that looking back I should have booted them out.Read less..."

Oftentimes these misunderstandings can be avoided by explaining what your privacy policy is. For example I had one guest you wanted me to do it but I didn't have to end the trip. I told her that I am out here doing ride-sharing and I'm pretty much by myself. This is for your Safety and Security as well as everybody else's. I told her the footage is kept private unless an incident comes up to where I have to turn it over to the Rideshare company, appropriate regulatory bodies, law enforcement, or to any appropriate individual if a court proceeding happens. Other than that it's confidential and it's on a loop and as long as there's no problem the footage will be recorded over. I haven't had someone be uncomfortable but the one who was I was able to calm them down and they were actually very apologetic and they understood my position.Read less..."

"Can I ask my Uber driver to NOT record me with his webcam? If I do not want to be recorded, shouldn't I be able to request that?",shipbuilderpilot,18070,17794,Very good post. I've been driving for Uber about a week pulled up to a bar had a woman get in who was not my pickup. My rider was waiting for me to get this person out of car. Video and audio saved me as I just called the police to have her removed she claimed all kinds of crap police reviewed video sent me on my way while she was arrested for public intoxication. I will never agree to turn off my camera or audio this is a perfect example of why we need one in the first place.
"Can I ask my Uber driver to NOT record me with his webcam? If I do not want to be recorded, shouldn't I be able to request that?",daisygirl,16344,CanIaskmyUbe,Since it is the drivers personal vehicle they have the right to record you. Just don't do anything you wouldnt want on camera :)
"Can I ask my Uber driver to NOT record me with his webcam? If I do not want to be recorded, shouldn't I be able to request that?",wraiththe,7747,CanIaskmyUbe,"You may ask.  I may have you recorded asking and comply.  Most likely I would turn the inside camera away if you asked and more likely if there was daylight.d  Especially if you were talking about sensitve business.   Most cameras loop and record over each segment once the drive is full... unless tagged.  Occasionally some people can get toxic and aggresive or even try to grope the driver.  If there are cameras inside, it is for our protection.  Just to be clear... what you are asking us is to lower our defenses and any kind of passive security and trust that you wont be agressive, try to sexually assault, hurt, or falsely accuse us, vandalize our cars, break the law, be verbally abusive, or lie about what was said.  I would feel more comfortable with a driver that has a camera rather than a weapon for their protection.Still, depending on the situation, I think most of us would consider complying."

"Can I ask my Uber driver to NOT record me with his webcam? If I do not want to be recorded, shouldn't I be able to request that?",ToneeJai,18442,CanIaskmyUbe,It all depends which state you live in. Texas is a one party consent state which means only one person has to consent therefore the driver can legally record with or without your consent. If the state you live in is a two party consent state then the driver must have your consent to record.
"Can I ask my Uber driver to NOT record me with his webcam? If I do not want to be recorded, shouldn't I be able to request that?",Wes,18324,CanIaskmyUbe,"You certainly have the rite to request it be turned off, however do so with the understanding that the driver has the right to refuse you the ride, which will result in you having to request another car/driver.The driver has the right to refuse, the passenger has a right to request.  But never lose sight of the fact that the driver is protecting YOU as much as they're protecting themselves.  Many cameras have both forward and backward viewing, so many drivers are more interested in the capturing the forward view in case of an accident."

How long are you in an Uber 10/60 min? What are you doing during that times that you want driver to shut camera off. If your on the phone and dont want your conversation recorded hello the driver can still hear you. Save private conversation for the appropriate places or text. I dont understand what you are doing or saying that being recorded would be an issue for you.  I get it may be uncomfortable but I can assure you most drivers go home download the day and never look at it again. I save footage for 30/60 days and then I get rid of it. I never go home and go over footage for the day unless their was an issue. I have not had to look over any footage to date. I dont have the time and no one that gets into my car is that important to me for me to care to look over it. If someone had an important business call and asked me to turn it off I would be ok with that.  Again you should really save sensitive/private conversation for your home or office. Have some respect & understanding for your driver.  Realize we pick up strangers all day and night we are far from safe out there. We want to go home to our husbands, wives, children, family, and friends at the end of our shift. We also want proof when riders send false accusations to Uber or Lyft  it happens all the time.  How would you feek if one day you went to work inky to be told you were fired? Sime steanger walked off the street lied and said you did something thst you didnt do. It also can help in accidents.

I have four signs  ONE posted at each door. if I think somebody may not understand the signs I will also explain it orally. A Rideshare vehicle is privately owned property not owned by the companies and as the owner of my property I have the right to install and use security measures provided I'm not breaking any laws doing it.if somebody doesn't consent to audio or video recording or use of a dash cam. They have a right not to consent to your conversation however your vehicle is private property. You have a right to end their trip in a safe location early if they don't consent. It's no different than going to the airport and wanting to get on an airplane without going through security. You have an absolute right to refuse the passengers screening but they have an absolute right not to allow you to board that aircraft or remain on Airport property.if you go to any concert venue or any other place that has metal detectors or bag checks and you don't consent to it. They have a right to refuse you admission.A Rideshare driver owns the vehicle that they are using and as long as the security they are doing is lawful. The driver is within his or her right to refuse service for failure to comply with security policies. When you're doing ride-sharing you're out there by yourself and you never know who you're picking up. The sad part is the vast majority of people you serve aren't the ones you have to worry about. It's less than 5% but only one of them can cost you a contract if they make a false allegation to Uber or Lyft or any of the other providers.Read less...

Ohio is a one party state and therefore it is up to the driver to decide here if they wouldn’t mind not recording you. However as long as you’re not doing anything you’re not supposed to I don’t see the issue with being recorded. Drivers only have it in their vehicles as a safety precaution. Not to do anything weird. Most videos left untouched are overwritten by new video content. So chances are they don’t even have it anymore.

No, it never crossed my mind.  One that stands out to me is the pax that cry the whole trip, because you know there is a deep story there - at least in my mind.I picked a girl up last night, who said very little and cried the whole trip of about 30 minutes. Mid day.  I did ask her if she was okay and she said she is fine. I offered a small water bottle I keep in the car, and she said no. I didn't say anything for the rest of the ride, while she wept the entire time.I decided to leave her alone and I said nothing for the rest of the ride. It was very uncomfortable, and I had the inclination to ask her what's wrong.  Would you guys have done anything differently? I'm sure she could have used a person to talk to."

You must be at least 18 years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different than 18), to obtain an Account, unless a specific Service permits otherwise.User Requirements and Conduct:The Service is not available for use by persons under the age of 18.

These short-term needs can take many forms, such as medical bills, rent, some big bill that just arose, or even food.  Uber/Lyft absolutely lets them do that.Some are getting intangible benefits from driving, such as social validation or psychic rewards.Some find driving to be almost like a game or form of entertainment, learning how to maximize income, finding better rides, mastering surges (haha), and so on.In fact, many drivers are being manipulated by Uber without knowing it. Uber uses very sophisticated psychological technigues to motivate drivers to do what's in Uber's best interests, whether or not it's in the drivers' best interests.In other words, there are many reasons drivers keep driving for Uber or Lyft even though they're not making as much money as they thought they would.Read less..."

If drivers are really losing money with Uber then why do you keep driving for Uber?,ChrisNorway1,5525,5446,"Thanks for sharing.  I don't drive but this is very educational.I agree that this is a interesting and rewarding job.  So perfect for a side gig.  You already have a car, and the flexibility must be awesome.So your expense calculation doesn't calculate the maintenance and car upkeep, right?   Or is the $75/week supposed to cover that for wear/tear, maintenance and repairs?  I've tried to do th emath once and failed miserably beacuse I didn't know how much maintenance and repair costs would increase after I beat it up as an Uber car."
If drivers are really losing money with Uber then why do you keep driving for Uber?,RedANT,5557,5525,"In my stated calculations, I neglected to add maintenance and upkeep, although I consider those to be minor expenses.  I subscribe to the service department email specials from (5) local Nissan dealerships, and generally have maintenance done once a month for ~$50 special.  (Full synthetic + tire rotation + 100 pt inspection earlier this week was $57)  Four new tires cost me $425 and are warrantied for 50k miles. (If you're a Costco member, get a price quote for tires, then have Firestone match it at 200% of the difference.  The savings will pay for your annual Costco membership fees)$425 per year for tires and $600 for oil and tire rotation is ~$1k per year, fairly in line with what I paid for service even before I drove for Uber and Lyft.  All things considered, in my case one can either put aside $20 a week for maintenance, of do as I do and establish credit card accounts for my business and charge/pay for items as required.  (I also use GasBuddy with my connected business debit card, with points credited to myShopYourWayUber account for free stuff)"
If drivers are really losing money with Uber then why do you keep driving for Uber?,ChrisNorway1,5564,5557,"You mentioned you drive 20 hours a week.  Is that consistent and how many miles would that total?  I saw another post that mentioned ""fulltime"" drivers can drive 1000 miles a week.  Is that in line with what you do?$20 a week in increased maintenance is not a problem."

I live in Los Angeles and you really can't just walk to places or take public transportation so I really do get a ton of rides on the days I work and I never have to worry about that stuff.

My wife works from home and I used to work right down the road so I wasn't really driving very much before I lost my job.Right now I just havezencarand they take care of all the maintainence and oil changes, tires, and everything so it's a win-win for me because if something else had happened to my family car and I wasnt able to pay for it my whole family would be screwed :/ I can't risk that.To clarify, I own my family car outright so it's not like I'm making payments on that plus leasing azencarlol."
If drivers are really losing money with Uber then why do you keep driving for Uber?,StuffinMuffin,5423,5366,"This is the problem.  Uber goes great lengths to hide the fact that being a driver really beats up on your car.  This isn't some gig you can do with only the upsides.  The problem is that it's very hard to calculate these costs of car maintenance, so many don't do it and Uber gets the benefit of the doubt that being a driver is a lucrative business."

If drivers are really losing money with Uber then why do you keep driving for Uber?,lacy,4923,Ifdriversare,"I drive for Lyft instead of Uber, but I do make money. It seems to me that people count the opportunity cost of driving as the reason people are not making money. There are times that it appears I am losing money when I am driving, but that is because if I do not have a time frame to be somewhere I will use the app and drive. I do not always get a fare, but when I do it actually offsets the cost of my traveling across town.Another reason is that you can always earn money by choosing to drive more often or around events, so even if you are not earning as much it is possible to make ends meet if you are having monetary difficulty. This is especially true for people who have trouble finding jobs. I do now have a job but I applied for almost a year before I could find work. In the meantime, Lyft was my entire source of income and while it did not pay as well as my last job, it kept my head above water."
If drivers are really losing money with Uber then why do you keep driving for Uber?,Bigfrank,5105,4923,"Why they really don't make money is for the following reasons :  Most drivers do not know the value of money in terms of inflation  and the rates for a nyc medallion is too cheap compared to other cities including forein countries so the uberized rates is sinfully and hurtful to unsuspecting drivers. You should never and ever buy a new car for app driving because you will lose on the front end and when your ready to sell your high mileage junk pile you must add 50000 miles to it and that is how much your car is worth. Black exterior is the worst color to have in NYC because it tell people to key it,kick it, open the door and hit something . Black will stay clean for a few hours in NYC and it's time for another $10 car wash which equals to about $2000 a year.

Does Uber's upfront fee get higher the more we check?,bettyvanwhy,19716,DoesUber'sup,I have never tested this theory out but lots of riders will complain that the rates do go up the more you check and that they also go up the more you ride. Uber definitely does some sketchy things...
Does Uber's upfront fee get higher the more we check?,MilanoMinis,19721,DoesUber'sup,"Don’t they say this about Amazon as well. Depending on who you are and how many times you clicked it, the price goes up.All automated and driven by AI."
Does Uber's upfront fee get higher the more we check?,Dat_Sun2,19701,DoesUber'sup,"Are you entering a future time, like scheduling a ride?  It may be that it costs more if you are closer to the time.For Lyft, if you are willing to wait, they give you a discount."
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,CWalcutt75,WhydoUberand,0,"I am actually a driver myself.  I agreed to all the rates and how much I get paid when I signed up, so why are other drivers so upset for not getting tips?  Is this a matter of expectation?"
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,DmianBlair,5190,WhydoUberand,"I don't get angry about it but it is sometimes annoying.I think it is mostly because people do usually tip taxi drivers but Uber has trained riders not to tip rideshare drivers, first by telling them ""the tip is included"" then by telling them ""there's no need to tip"" after they were sued. People didn't just decide overnight to stop tipping drivers. Uber intentionally discouraged tipping to keep riders spending more of their travel budget on fares & less on tips.I also find it annoying when riders promise a tip then don't follow through. But in this case I am more annoyed by the dishonesty than the not tipping itself."
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,johnblotter,5200,5190,"I actually find this happens fairly frequently, riders will promise a tip on the app and then never do. Some will apologize and say ""sorry I don't have any cash on me, I'll get you on the app"". or I have seen passengers talk loudly between the two like ""make sure to tip"" or ""do you have cash? no? we can tip on the app"". But they never do."
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,Norm22,5209,5200,"It is their way of saving face. I never understood it otherwise. I don't expect or suggest tips. If you ask I will answer, but to say ""I am out of cash / I will take care of you on the app"" is code for, I won't tip you because I am cheap and will never see you again. If you don't want to tip then don't. No need to pretend you are going to. 1 out of 10 say this out loud and actually do. Usually other drivers taking a ride, or someone who honestly wants to tip. Better not to say anything except thanks or have a good day. That is better than the former."
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,RainbowRash,5333,5209,"We have to admit as a society that we tip out of guilty than a kind heart.  Bleh.  It's like how you want to be seen when stuffing a dollar into the tip jar at Starbucks.  You'd hate it if the workers didn't see it, you know?That's why they say, ""I will tip"".  To save safe.Sad, I know."
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,johnblotter,5212,5209,"Yes, this ""code"" is so true - ""I won't tip you because I am cheap and will never see you again""I guess people have no moral compass when they can get away with it."
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,BrianTheScrewDriver,5432,5190,"I wonder if the lack of tipping has to do with the perception of Uber drivers being ""casual"" drivers who are ""just like and me.""  ""Making a few bucks on the side"" (and enjoying a fancy dinner per Uber TV commercials)I think this perception is very different than looking at a professional taxi drivers who do it for a living and perhaps struggling to make ends meet.  I think consumers think Uber drivers have real gigs on the side and basically only doing this to a) meet people, b) kill time, c) make more money than we are already making, etc.....basically they assume we don't need the money."
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,Bigfrank,12756,5190,People do not tip because they are tightwads and would trade their mother for a tic tac especially the millennials.
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,Bigfrank,19804,WhydoUberand,There is a high turnover rate because drivers realize that their return on investment is not worth it especially in NYC . I run a small private cab service and all my customers tip well because I can develop relationships with them and they appreciate this kind of service . App companies cannot and are  not interested to do so which is why the star system is in place  Most people do not have clue of what customer service is and are satisfied with the star system .
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,MilanoMinis,3359,WhydoUberand,"Uber made a variant attempt to make it a cashless and tipless experience, but they miserably failed.  They had pressure from Lyft and drivers and they finally gave in.  There should be something to be learned from there.  Such a large and powerful entity like Uber attempted to eliminate tips but they couldn't.  That means that this tipping is not unnatural.  It was demanded by the market.  by the people.  It wasn't some weird concept generated or outlined by someone or some entity.So, natural selection do its work.  This is the right direction, and we should all accept it.  Drivers are services personnel and they should get paid tips along aside hairdresser, bellboy, housekeeping, waitresses, etc."

Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,RacRay79,3356,WhydoUberand,"Riders routinely tip taxi drivers, even though the taxi rates are often 2x–3x as much as an Uber ride.Riders routinely tip the pizza delivery who drove a mile and a half to deliver. They’re paid an hourly plus tips.Riders routinely tip the barista that makes their latte, even though the he is paid a salary and it’s part of their job.Riders routinely tip waitresses who carry your food 30 feet from the restaurant kitchen to your table. They, too receive a salary plus tip.An Uber drivers drives 10 minutes out of their way to pick you up, waits 5 minutes while you fool around inside, then drives you to your destination in a car that they pay for, in a car they pay to insure, using the gas that’s paid for out of their own pockets, and they get you to your destination safely, and all you can ask is why should you tip them? Really?"
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,breakingbread,3432,3356,THIS. Right here. Why wouldn't you tip?
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,HuhnHuhn,3360,WhydoUberand,"I know there are people who are against tips in general or just the concept of it. I can see their argument on how the rates should be set to cover all costs and it shouldn't be pushed down to the passengers, etc.  Then the drivers argue they aren't getting paid.  Then people say that's not their problem, maybe it's Uber's.However, I think everyone is forgetting one important thing about tipping.It's meant to be there to reward the person for a job well done.This is why you see it most often in the service industry.Uber and Lyft driving is a service and some drivers can do a good job and some won't.  The amount of tip should reflect that.   Am I the only person who thinks people are blowing this discussion to unnecessary levels?"
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,franciash,3431,3360,"Exactly tipping should be for a job well done IMO, I am not tipping some sub standard driver who is just whiny about not making enough money. You want my tip, go above and beyond."
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,SmittenKitten,3358,WhydoUberand,"This whole thing is flawed. Drivers aren't happy because they aren't getting paid enough per rates set by Uber.  Now the riders and passengers are arguing as to how much needs to be paid.  It's all messed up.Drivers demand they get pad tips because Uber doesn't listen.  Passengers can be shamed into it, so that's where they turn.In a P2P on-demand service, one entity shouldn't be setting a price.A better business model would allow all parties (riders and drivers) to bid and agree on a price.Uber can be more like eBay, where as the facilitator, they can take a cut of that and be happy."
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,TomHarding,5201,WhydoUberand,"As a driver I've seen pasengers tip the baggage boy, the hotel guy that opens the car door and cab drivers. I tip the server at restuarants. I'm providing a personal service the same as other do, yet tips are not done very often. So drivers get a little angry when they provide personal service, help with luggage and groceries and not get tipped.A tip is a gesture of thanks for the service."
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,RPaulson,5309,5201,"The bellboy, the doormen, and taxi driver.  That's three tips in one short swoop.  Amazing people don't see Uber drivers as providing services.  Not sure where things went wrong."
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,chipsavoy,3430,WhydoUberand,The whole premise of tipping is absurd IMO. It seems demeaning and rude. Why can't the US just get on board with the rest of the world and actually pay service personnel what they deserve! I would gladly pay a few extra bucks in a taxi or for my burger if I knew I didnt have to tip.
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,WWBlueStuff,5227,WhydoUberand,"How do you even know they become so angry?  Honestly, I am way over that.  I think many drivers believe on tip and demand it, but the expectation is totally a different thing.  I get tip on 1/3 of my rides, if that.  and they are enough to round off to the next five.  So a few bucks."
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,Bigfrank,5109,WhydoUberand,Are you brain dead ? The rates are so cheap that it is better to deliver pizza and get a tip than it is to drive tightwads .
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,LCarpenter,5310,5109,You should try UberEats.  It's even worse.
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,RPaulson,3362,WhydoUberand,"It's the perception.  The non-surge fares are way too low to sustain a successful career, to the point that they are losing money unless they get tips.  That's how slim the margins are.I am a driver, and I can say that this depends on where you drive as a driver.  If you work in the city and taking many short trips, the per mile rate really doesn't add up and I hear you don't really get paid.  (People are less likely to tip on a $5 ride, especially due to a large portion of that being a booking fee that goes entirely to Uber.)  Then you are often stuck in traffic which diminishes your per minute rate.  It's tough.I drive in the suburbs, but in populated and busy areas such as the mall, where the trips are much longer.  My trips are more like 5 to 10 miles, and those definitely do work out much better.  and ironically, I get paid more tips in the 20~30% range."
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,TravTravTravis,3363,3362,"You can't blame the passengers for not tippping on those shorter trips.  Due to Uber's booking fee and minimum fare, they paid a very high per mile/minute fee.Uber really should be lowering their booking fees for those shorter rides.  It's killing the drivers and passengers are already paying the premium."
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,Norm22,5210,3363,"Uber should ease their take and actually pay a per ride bonus to the drivers if they are gonna stick with the tip-included nonsense. If they gave half of their booking fee to the driver things would be much sunnier. Never gonna hsappen though so it is what it has become. Not to mention the claims from Uber that you can make bonuses every week or series of rides. Not in my town, promotions tab always says ""there are currently no promotions offered or upcoming""."
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,DonutDrivers,3361,WhydoUberand,Because you tip everyone else.  We get very low wages below minimum wage and get our car trashed by rude pompous passengers.
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,KWalkins,3357,WhydoUberand,"I blame Uber for this, but yeah, it's because the drivers are getting the bummed part of the deal.  The prices are set way too low, 1/2 as much as taxis, in order for Uber to sign up more users and to spread their dominance.  Drivers are paying the cost as the riders completely benefit.Uber must know that drivers weren't going to make enough money when they did the math and set the prices.  So they must be counting on how people will tip.  Have our ""salary"" be subsidized by the riders.  So, please, riders.  You have to tip for this business model to work.  It was designed that way by Uber."
Why do Uber and Lyft drivers become so angry when riders don't tip?,AsStibelDude,3355,WhydoUberand,"Yes, it's the expectation.  That's where you are wrong.  At the time of sign up, we did our research and assumed we would be getting a certain amount of tips to rides.  Currently, the rates set by Uber are just too low for us to meet a decent wage.  We hear about all these promises on how much we would make (usually backed by amazing success stories that remind me of those pyramid scheme sales people), but the truth is that we won't be making $90K a year."

Lyft went public so they could avoid all the labor lawsuits against them and as of this comment the stock is sinking and hopefully goes into the bowels of hell where it belongs.

I pull up to Cottman and Torresdale Ave. Not a great neighborhood but not the worst here in PhillyThere is a beautiful Husky with a leash roaming the middle of the busy intersection no tags. So I pull over & decide to get out slowly in case this dog bites. He comes barreling around the car as soon as I open door and tries to climb on my lap and starts to cry. Ok at least he is friendly. I call a 24 hr. Vet ask what they can suggest I do. They give me animal control's number. I call them guy responds""bring him to Front & Huntingdon park and put him in a cage"" and hung up. Ok what cage, where is it on the property? Then it hit me. It's now 2:30 am unless you have bullet proof body armour and bullet proof car and you are packing (and i dont mean lunch). There is no way I am going to that hood at 230pm let alone 230am. So I am standing in front of my double parked car with a dog trying to figure out what to do. Some nice people would ask if I was ok some were just a little shady (especially one man who pulled over a block away & watched me for 10 min) All i could here in my head was my dad screaming at me ""are you crazy that time of morning in either of those hoods are you an idiot""? I am sure he was doing flips in his grave. So now I google ""can i call 911 for a stray dog in Phila"" google says yes so it must be ok right. I call 911 operator responds ""I guess you want them to come get dog"" I say well yes i cant leave him roaming the streets. Did I mention dog had an odor that wasnt a good one and was scratching and biting at his skin so I assume he had at the very least fleas, I cant put him in my clean nice smelling Uber or next rider may rate me 1 star for smell.. Now its after 3am I need to get off this corner. I know damn right well every police car in the district is avoiding that intersection like the plague  Ten more min. go by I finally see a police car and flag him down. An Officer out of his district (from next district over) must have felt sorry for me or it was Divine Intervention. He gets out of car I explain my dilemma (i all ready have a dog, dont have time for another dog, & most imp. I cant put dirty, smelly, flea ridden dog in my car as I drive for Uber my ratings will drop) He then takes some info from me and takes this beautiful Husky in the back of his car. I was truly grateful. Shout out to Officer Milligan. Only in an Uber.If you enjoy these stories I have plenty more. At least once a week something funny, crazy, or bad happens while driving for Uber.  I would love to hear some of your driver or rider stories.

Some nights I have a great time and some nights after 3 or 4 rides I go home because it was just awful. Just 1 person can make or break your night, set the mood for the rest of your shift. Some nights I come home and feel like I was out all night having fun with friends. Other nights I cant wait to get it over with and I swear thats it never driving again. When I have a few riders in a row 3 is my magic number lol that just pull me down, make my spirits low etc I go in for the night. I go out earlier next day and hope my luck changes. Full moon nights can be interesting. Trust me you will learn some lessons. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Then you get that one rider that makes up for all the idiots. Lol More decent riders than not so decent. I thought I had stories to tell from what I seen in wirking in hospitals, nursing homes  doctors offices but Ubering definately will give you stories to tell. Lol Thank you for your comment. Even though you called me crazy. Lol. I have plenty of stories to tell if you like hearing them I have no problem telling them. Take careRead less..."

We got there at 2:02am and shocker the bar wouldnt let them in. I counted my blessings they were happy drunks and got out of there before they had time to ask me to take them back home. Although it probably would've been safer to take rhem home than it was standing on the corner with the dog. I did  find out later that the police have been dealing with prostitution on that corner. New age prostitution, you can proposition the female or the dog your choice.lol Dont know what happened to the drunk guys maybe they found a prostitute and had a fun night or they got another Uber driver to torture.

I thought you were saying that those ""drunk"" guys were actually masterminds and this whole thing was a plan to get prostitutes.  If the guys requested a rider immediately, it would have pinged you, as you were probably the closest driver!I usually turn off my phone for a few minutes after I cancel any ride.

When I seen it was a female I felt better"".  ""I didnt want a creepy guy picking me up with my bare ass hanging out"", Umm did I just hear her correctly?  I find myself asking that question on many Uber rides, sometimes I think I hear things incorrectly. Unfortunately on these rides my hearing is just fine. IThe light comes on, it becomes crystal clear my rider is sitting in my back seat with a light up tutu with a bare ass not to mention what else is bare. As I process all this we reach destination. Dont know how she is going to explain this to her mom. Good luck. I pull a few blocks away and pull over,  my reaction out loud talking to myself ""wtf is wrong with these people"". I gloved, gowned, masked, got the bio hazard bag and began scrubbing my seat. I then took a can of lysol and doused my seat in it. Some things I thought about while cleaning the car? Where were the tights? Were they under the dude she slept with and just wanted to escape without waking him? Why didnt she ask to borrow a pair of boxers, sweats, shorts, even a damn trash bag? Who the hell does this? I have that answer Millennials! What kind of parents does she have that she feels she could walk through the front door like that?

A Night In The Life of An Uber Driver! Drivers/Riders please share your story!,momof4,8217,ANightInTheL,"Saturday night I pick up 4 guys in mid to late 20's . First topic of conversation is their friend talking about another friend at a strip club. The friend steals recently deceased grandmother's credit card. Doesnt charge anything worthwhile but goes to strip club and spends 4,000.00 + there. My 1st thought was what an awful grandchild. Next thought is how can you spend that much in one night? I am going to assume maybe he got to take a few strippers home for the night? How much can a lap dance cost? Alcohol? BTW he didnt take any of his friends with him. How rude! Last thought what an idiot. Maybe someone can explain what he spent over 4,000.00 on. He did get caught. Mom had a lot of explaining to do to credit card company. Son has to pay it all back to credit card company. Hope he got something good and memorable that night. Hopefully not an STD. Moral of story dont steal dead grandmothers cc cause even though deceased she got payback."

We pull up to red light and she tells me to go through it. I'm good waiting for the green was my response. She starts talking to me & telling me about the male stripper that someone had ordered for the girl in the back (her bachlorette party). She was complaining how old, saggy, and hairy he was. Then she tells me about the strip club they went to. Apparently the male stripper picked big mouth cop to come up on stage. He asks what type of underwear she had on.? She replies a ""gstring you wanna smell them""? He replies, ""I think we need a new volunteer up here"". She thinks it is hysterical and I guess normal. This goes back and forth about the night  at the strip club. We pull up to the bar she gets out and drops the bottle as it shatters and splashes everywhere. Thankfully not in my car. She then proceeds to tell the 5 people standing outside to mind their own business i'm a cop. Wth is wrong with these women? I thought the strippers I picked up were bad. The customers are even worse. I've picked up men from strip clubs and they dont feel the need to tell me about their night at the strip club. Thankfully. Why do people feel the need to tell things like this to their Uber driver? She did hand me a 20.00 tip though. As soon as they exit I get out of there. I take a few rides and its now 2am I get a ride request to pick up at Brick House but name is different from crazy drunk big mouth badge carrying beer dropping cop. I sit for 2 min. and out comes???? You guessed it. It was the even more drunk crazy big mouth badge carrying beer dropping cop. Now bride to be is really drunk looking for a penis straw she dropped. She asks if she can dump her drink out the window. I say go for it as I really dont want alcohol in my car & road was deserted. She decides to wait until 2 cars are behind us and proceeds to throw a drink out the window. Not the alcohol I thought she meant the whole cup with penis straw and alcohol. So of course it hits the car behind us. They pull besides my car yelling and screaming. Drunk crazy cop pulls badge out and slurs ""get out of hear before I have you locked up"". Thankfully it was a group of teens that she was able to scare away with her badge. That was my last ride for the night . When your 1st pick up after 2am is a disaster its time to head home for the night before it gets worse.Read less..."

Many keep to themselves, but it's pretty obvious when they are ""working.""Taxis is the primary transport for working girls (and men).  If I drove the weekends, I would regularly get calls from them.  In some cases, I've been told to wait outside because the stop will be quick.  So many stories I can share....Most obvious times were always 2:00AM to 5:00AM on the weekends.  Then again, they do happen at other times too.  Random Tuesday nights.  Random Thursday mornings.

I mean who looks like that at those hours?  and riding alone?  Dressed like that?There are also other queues, right?  Like cash payments.  Going to a new address, and she is not aware of the destination.Also remember that I used to drive a taxi and some clients would call me.  I had regulars that used my service in Allston/Boston to get around.  They would call me up and I have seen patterns in their rides and where their ""customers"" lived."

I should've left when I was eligible for cancel fee. We drive a mile GPS says make left turn screaming stripper barks order i will tell you where to go. We go another mile another barking order ""pull into that gas station I need something"". She needed something all right some manners or a foot up her ass. I pull in to this gas station that is packed has a line of cars to get in (will explain the line of cars at 3am at a gas station another time). I finally get into lot she gets out and I plot my escape. Why should I take her screaming, order barking ass anywhere else they dont pay me enough for this? I put the car in drive ready to pull out and my guilty conscience kicks in. Its 3am you cant do that. Then the  little devil on my shoulder says go for it. Good conscience won I stayed but when she got back in I had a little talk with her. By the time i dropped her off she was happy. So happy when she got out she said ""i am going to give you 5 stars"". I wanted to reply ""stick your 5 stars so far up (that thing you shake for money)that they shoot out of your mouth and hand over some of those bills you made tonight.  She was out right rude and bossy.The 2nd stripper I picked up didnt yell at me but she also barked orders. Wont get into much detail as I just wrote a book about stripper #1. Her barking orders were hello as she entered car  order #1""put this radio station on, order #2 turn volumn up ill tell you when to stop"" #3 dont speak to me while music is on #4 put the heat up. No please no thank you ànd you guessed it no tip. Last but not least we pull up to destination my app shows end trip you've arrived i end it wait for her to get the hell out. But she needs to bark 1 more order #5 ""I've never been here before just sit here until I can find my friend then you can leave"". Must be a stripper thing to bark orders and not tip. These 2 were in my first month of driving they taught me a few things that night.  No, one of those things was not how to work a stripper pole. Thanks for sharing R Paulson.

After I confronted her in a nice polite way her attitude changed. She said she had a ”long night"". She also said all the drivers pick her up in the wrong place (the spot where I went, where the app showed). I wanted to say if you know this why don't you send the drivers's a text. Decided against it didn't want to ruin the mood she was in or make her night longer. I still can't figure out why she was so concerned about me talking to the people in the car (I wasn't ) but she went on about that for a few minutes screaming at me in the beginning of ride. I avoid that area now. Thank you fir your comment."

When they hang up my driver turns to me and says Ill give you 3 gueses as to who you were just speaking with. Turns out it was Mike Eruzione!!

Hate it down there but it was surged and consecitive ride bonus was offered. Wasnt going to make it back to burbs so stayed there. Uber screwed up pick up location and sent me towards an old off ramp on 95 now closed and oncoming traffic to be T boned. I then realized I left my bullet proof car and vest at home along with my body armour and gun. Shit went wrong in first 2 min of accepting trip it was just going to get worse. I cancelled. I then ended up over by Sugar House Casino on small side street  so I could turn around and get the hell outta there. Its 2am and no street lights and had a pair of 10 yr old glasses on. I can assure you what I seen next was as clear as day. A somewhat decent 20 something girl in an extremely short dress and high heels is headed towards casino.

These programs are still new and are often being rolled out in limited cities or quantities. Here are three areas that you want to explore.  Make sure to check the last section on Ride Passes and Commuter Programs.1) Frequent Rider ProgramsUber and Lyfthave both experimented with frequent rider programs, where you are rewarded with free trips or ride credits.  We are not aware of any of these being offered consistently, but here are a few links:TechCrunch Article,UberVIP in NYC and Dallas.Fastenis a company that has successfully implemented a frequent rider program. This generous program offers credits for future rides and are applied to all riders automatically.  Currently, they are offering $5 credit for taking 10 rideshttps://fasten.com/us/karma2) Prepaid Gift CardsUber and Lyft offer prepaid gift cards, and they are available at major retailers.  Check out this link to find out stores where they are available.Uber Gift Cards.Occasionally, these retailers offer discounts so you may want to look out for them.  You may also be able to buy them through gift exchange/trade programs at a site likeGiftCardZen. (It looks like you can currently purchase a $50 Uber cards for $47.Try buying these gift cards using your credit card that offer rebates, cash back, or points. This may also be a way to save a few percentages on Uber rides.3) ""Ride Passes"" or Commuter PassesBoth Uber and Lyft have offered passes and pre-paid cards in the past.   The one for Uber is called ""Ride Pass"" and the one for Lyft is called ""Lyft Line Pass.""  Unfortunately, they are only offered in limited quantities and for Lyft, I am not sure if they offer this anymore.  (If I find out more, I will update this post.)Lyft - ""Lyft Line Pass""- One option (Option 1) is to pay $20 upfront and every ride will be $2 for that month.  The other option (Option 2) is to pay $29 upfront and all the rides are covered.  This no longer seems ot be available, but here's a link to a past blog post:https://blog.lyft.com/posts/now-on-sale-membership-passes-for-novemberUber - ""Ride Pass""- In exchange for an upfront fee, Uber guarantees the price or at least the discout for all the rides within that month. The price and discounts depend on the city, but in oneexample, a rider paid $12 upfront and paid $3.49 for UberPools (capped at $15) and $6.99 UberXs (capped at $20).  If the price of the ride is higher than the cap, the rest is must be paid by the rider.  So, this is a great deal!What is Ride Pass - More information from UberSign up and Check Availability BelowThis program as we understand is limited to limited cities and limited in quantity.  Some report that invitations are being sent to a sample group of current users.  Here's a list created by Jing from thisblog.San FranciscoNew YorkLos AngelesSan DiegoBostonChicagoMiamiSeattleWashington D.C.DenverDallasHoustonAtlantaPhoenixAustinNew Orleansippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Apr 28, 2018"

All of your solutions are app (Uber/Lyft) based. How about the option where the driver makes a daily arrangement to carry a rider to work or school, many times at a discount rate of 10% because the driver keeps the other 15% he would be paying Uber. It's a win/win for driver and rider. They get what they want, at a profit (10% for rider 15% for driver)and leave Uber out in the cold."

Another hiccup for Uber: Some drivers were being charged for giving rides [CNN],SmittenKitten,Anotherhiccu,0,"Whatever happened to driver shortage and outrageous prices?(CNN Business)When a Chicago-area Uber driver checked his account balance after dropping off a customer at the airport on a Sunday morning in late May, he discovered something he'd never seen before: He was charged $2.20 for giving a 13.5 mile ride.""On my 40-minute ride home, I was thinking about how I just lost money driving somebody,"" said the driver, Kurt, who asked that his last name be withheld for privacy reasons.Kurt said he submitted a request in the driver app for a fare review but the company said his fare was calculated correctly. (Uber told CNN Business this was an automated response sent in error.) He called driver support, which indicated that agents were unavailable during the weekend.

This practice does happen.This is something that some drivers are known to practice.  To voice their frustrations, some drivers are known to automatically leave negative reviews (i.e. 1-star rating) for short trips and UberPool.  It's hard to tell how many drivers engage in this behavior but they do.I don't agree wtih this, as the users should not be penalized for simply using Uber.  You can even tell in this thread that drivers HATE short trips.

You literally sound like the most normal human being ever. That's a compliment. What I mean is, the way you handle yourself is what is expected out of every single human, even though sadly most humans are flawed in this subject and think they're the king or queen of their fantasy kingdom :P. I'm glad I saw this forum and saw your reply. I wish more people had the understanding you have. Especially in certain situations. For example, my career is in restaurant management and customer service management and I've been in the field for over a decade. What really upsets me is when something small may happen or someone might not make a mistake at all but whatever happened infuriates a customer. Let's say someone asked for an extra salsa for their party and chips and salsa are free and are given right as you are seated. Let's also add on to this scenario and say it's super busy as well. So the table asks for an extra salsa, gets the one but the server forgot or maybe the kitchen forgot to ring in or serve the extra dish of salsa. Most people would shrug it off and maybe just ask again or not as they would notice it's super busy, but you get a lady who is just so pissed the server didn't bring the extra salsa. That lady will ask to speak with me and she will bitch about it and I'd most likely comp a meal or something, but the lady takes it to a whole other level and contacts corporate to complain. Let's go back and see, the server who was waiting on them is a 18 year old single mom who works 3 jobs to support herself and her child and takes classes every night at the community college. She depends on this job, but you get this lady who bitches to corporate, I get a call from corporate giving me an order to reprimand the employee and fire her... People will complain about the smallest, most petty crap. They're the world's most selfish  people and not once did that lady think about why maybe it was forgotten or maybe it was so busy that the salsa ticket was in, but because of the busy-ness, it had yet to reach the window. None of that crossed her mind. She did not ONCE think about how her actions (complaining) about such a small thing would impact the waitress and because of the ladys selfishness, that server is now down a job, can't afford rent, can't afford school or day care, etc.I live in a very afuent area. The county I live in is the richest in the whole country and rich white folk (I'm white as well, not that it matters) run rampant here and the scenario I just described, happened on the daily, if not multiple times a day. I absolutely hate it. If you go an hour or 2 south, you would never hear  about such a thing. Rich city people suck ass; are stingy and selfish to the MAX!!Sorry for the length.... I just had to rant.Read less..."

They get to rate and comment on the driver but not the other way around . Someone just said in a previous comment why should you care how we rate our riders it doesn't affect you.

Do Uber drivers give negative reviews (1-star ratings) for short trips? I know they don't like them.,bigrussdry,18961,DoUberdriver,"Absolutely I give low ratings for short fares. Especially if I have to travel 5 miles or so to take them 1 mile. There are exceptions to this however, like if a rider has groceries and or a disability where they cannot walk. Also if the weather is poor. It is flat out rude Uber and lyft don’t pay for pickup and the rider rarely tips for this occasion. Uber does if it’s further than 10 mins but in my opinion, pick up premiums need to start if the fare is more than 5 mins away."

They cannot control how far away you are when Uber pings you. AND many people need rides for short distances, whether they physically cannot walk that far, have a lot to carry, or it is raining. Why would you punish the passenger for this? Sure, be mad at Uber for having a crappy algorithm that doesn't pay you more for these situations but this is in no way the riders fault."
Do Uber drivers give negative reviews (1-star ratings) for short trips? I know they don't like them.,bigrussdry,18967,18964,"Also to add by having to drive several miles to pick up a rider and take them a block down the road only pays us $3. That is a loss for us and is charity work! We have every right to decline those trips unless Uber/lyft increase that to something more substantial . With lyft I give a 3 star to never receive that rider again , and since I live in a rural area with Uber I screenshot the rider name with pick up and drop off, save it into my phone . If I see them pop up on my app again, I immediately Cancel the ride"
Do Uber drivers give negative reviews (1-star ratings) for short trips? I know they don't like them.,bigrussdry,18965,18964,"The majority of it is due to Uber and lyft policy. Much of it depends on the passenger and circumstances. Generally if the passenger is say someone  with groceries  and or who cannot walk, I understand that. There are always exceptions. However I have to travel many miles to take people down the road on nice days who can easily have walked it. Also to add with Uber you cannot rate the rider up to 24hrs after like lyft. Which they should change. Because if the rider with the short trip leaves a tip even if it’s $1.00 I’ll change it most of the time from a 3-4 star right back up to a 5"
Do Uber drivers give negative reviews (1-star ratings) for short trips? I know they don't like them.,bett,18968,18965,"Sure, I can understand declining these types of trips, that makes sense. But to accept and pick up a passenger and then give them a low rating seems wrong. The passenger is this situation did nothing wrong and you are essentially saying ""I am ok giving this short ride"" by accepting.Agreed, that drivers should be able to change ratings, I don't understand why this is a rule in the first place. I suppose they don't want drivers going back and giving low ratings for non-tippers?"
Do Uber drivers give negative reviews (1-star ratings) for short trips? I know they don't like them.,bigrussdry,18969,18968,Uber and lyft never let us know the duration of the trip upon accepting unless our acceptance rate is very high which is extremely hard to make. Thus we are tricked into accepting these rides! And you’re right Uber doesn’t want driver’s derating riders for not tipping . But we should have every right to. They don’t even let us unpair ourselves from a rider even if we give them a 1 star. We have to call the support and explain the situation. This is why I screen shot the riders info and save it into my phone in regards to  uber

Most men do not believe women or they think it’s not a big deal. 3. I’m not saying all men are clueless but they can rarely understand the fear many women have about a male driver. The company can not deny a male driver from applying and working for them. But a female passenger has every right to choose. When looking for a doctor or OBGYN I alway pick a women. My first assault was by a male doctor in his office when I was young. Therefore never again a male doctor. I’ve also had a gun to my head, while he attempted to assult me. thankfully I was able to take the gun away, no idea where I got the bravery to do that but thank god I did. I want to be a driver for urber but I do not want to drive men. I fear they have a gun, knife, rope. Or just harass me the whole time we are driving. I’ve had too many horrible experiences. Yet never ever had one problem with a woman. When looking for a gym  I pick a female only= no harassment.  Not because I hate men but because I feel safer. I just want to be safe. Am I not allowed to feel safe and pick a woman to drive me? Do you really have to bitch about the very small segment where woman want to have women drivers? Go work somewhere else. I’m very attractive I’m not self absorbed, what I’m saying is being hit on daily really pisses me off. I don’t want to pay Uber to be harassed  by the driver. Even if I say I’m not interested it’s like they don’t get the message. Which is “leave me the Fuck alone.” Any dumbass that posts in here about male discrimination is delusional. You have dominated ever single area of business and employment. Do you honestly feel allowing a woman to chose another woman for safety reasons is discrimination?. A consumer has the right to choose but an employer does not get to discriminate. So nothing illegal is going on if I want a female driver. Get off your lame an imaginary reverse discriminational soap box. Stop feeling sorry for yourselves or try to corner every market.

How can I specify a female driver?,JBurd,9039,8792,"Being lost, making you late, and ending up charging you are not necessarily qualities of male drivers. That can happen with anyone. A sexist person may say it'd happen more with females as they get lost easier.  (I didn't say it. I am a sexist person would. Ha!)"

They might roll out a similar feature for drivers in the future, because they could also potentially be in a dangerous situation too.Here is how to use the panic button:https://ride.guru/content/newsroom/how-to-use-ubers-911-panic-button"
How can I specify a female driver?,momof4,9084,5765,In Philadelephia they have it for drivers in new app. Its actually better to go through app then to call 911. Uber knows your location. When you call 911 they dont always know your location.  In some cases they have been off by 10 miles. Emergency 911 is not updated enough and cannot always pinpoint your location. They say they can pinpoint location in approx 10% of the calls. So although it seems easier and faster for you to call on your own better to go through app. New drivers app has a shield a bottom right of map screen its there that you can get Uber to contact 911.
How can I specify a female driver?,PFontanetta,9167,9084,That’s a fantastic point about how Uber knows your location.
How can I specify a female driver?,momof4,9172,9167,It seems pointless to go through Uber app when you can just call 911. So after checking into this I found that most all states do not have updated capabilities of tracking the callers location. They can only find callers location in 10% of the calls.  I believe all states have to upgraded by 2023 (I may be off on the date) that is a long time away. I live in Philly 4 blocks away from Bucks County. When I call 911 from my cell I get Bensalem (Bucks County) I have to tell why I called only to be told to hold on while they contact Philly and transfer the call. Its frustrating in an emergency. If you go through the Uber app they know your exact location and give it to police radio 911.
How can I specify a female driver?,LG-PA,9206,9172,The reason Bensalem police dispatch wants to boot you to Philly is most likely because they want to keep their crime rate stats down:) As if you report a crime in a particular town it goes against theoir record (at least I think so)
How can I specify a female driver?,momof4,9207,9206,I want to reach Philly 911 but my location is picked up that I am in Bensalem. I live a few blocks from city line. It's awful when you have a medical emergency.

"As an Uber/Lyft passenger, what was the strangest/funniest ride you have taken",fpressly,AsanUber/Lyf,0,I have ridden Uber/Lyft quite a bit when I travel abroad or even around the US. There are bound to be good stories about funny or strange things happening on those rides.Thanks for your upvote.
"As an Uber/Lyft passenger, what was the strangest/funniest ride you have taken",fpressly,7302,AsanUber/Lyf,"I was picked up local Uber by a chubby Black girl (Regina). With a blonde wig and frilly light green Summer skirt she was quite the showman. Sparkling eyes and plump full lips slathered with a rich red lipstick made her provocative. She was talkative and flirtatious. She laughed with a stifled giggle that captured the moment. We talked for about 20 minutes about her being a cheerleader in high school and now in college driving Uber to make a little extra money. Regina turned and with a slight tilt of her head, her life story came tumbling out. It was a tale of abuse and addictions. Families laid waste. A captivating tale. The angled tilt of her head revealed a startling piece of information about this nubile leader of cheers. Regina had an adam’s apple. Suddenly 250 pound cheerleaders with facial hair drew a hilarious picture that brought a loud spontaneous guffaw from me. I had to hide my face to stifle the laughter. Thanks for your upvote."

Uber Deactivation for Safety Concerns,npriddy,UberDeactiva,0,"This week I was three weeks from my two year anniversary with Uber. I have a 4.94 rating (490 5 star, 4 4 star, 6 1 star) and I have done over 4800 rides. I have had no accidents, only one ticket over a year and a half ago and it was my word against the officers (yellow light/officer said red). I never cancel on riders other than no-shows or extreme conditions such as the car breaking down. I almost always beat the time given on the app - I never pause when going to get a passenger. I felt I was doing the best any driver could possibly do. I go out of my way to help my passengers. This last week I get this message on my app that said ""Account needs attention"" and something like ""Please contact support"". When I tried to go online Friday night it wouldn't let me. 24 hours later I get a response. ""During a recent review, we noted that your account is associated with multiple reports of safety concerns. You were previously notified that repeated reports of this nature could lead to loss of access to Uber apps. As a result, your account has been deactivated."" I questioned them an they just kept up with the same basic response and wouldn't tell what the safety concerns were. I only know of one complaint back in May where a rider complained I didn't wear a mask, but that NEVER happened. I wore my mask religiously. At the time I tried handling it but was ignored. It was a false report. I am deactivated and have been completely cut off now. In my mind I think someone at Uber decided to get rid of some drivers in this area and fired me and used ""safety concerns"" as a reason. I don't believe this had anything to do with safety concerns. Anyone else experiencing this?"
Uber Deactivation for Safety Concerns,JessicaBordelon,18673,UberDeactiva,You will not get anywhere messaging them. They rarely read the messages and just “auto reply.” It’s infuriating!!!The ONLY way to address the issue and get reactivated is to go into one of their Greenlight Offices. The associates there are always very helpful. They will look up any complaints in the system and provide you with detailed information in the unlikely event they are substantiated.They will then be able to contact corporate/customer service directly for you to correct all discrepancies and reactivate your account.

At root, it's unadulterated greed which drives them all.A taxi is a unique combination of private and public enterprise. Though individual vehicles may be privately owned, the service itself is part of public transportation service and is thus regulated by local governments.

How do I avoid them?",KWalkins,"Whatisthe""cl",0,I heard from my nephew that Uber drives are sometimes so desperate to make money that they would randomly charge cleaning fees for no reason whatsoever.  Is this true?  What can I do to stop it or make sure it doesn't happen.
"What is the ""cleaning fees"" and ""vomit"" SCAM by Uber drivers? Should I be concerned? How do I avoid them?","ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLC",ippei1202Ube,"Whatisthe""cl","Cleaning Fee is disputed often. Some are blatant scams. Some are in gray areas.The ""cleaning fee scam"" is when an Uber driverfabricatesorexaggeratesdamages to their vehicle in order to collect a large cleaning fee.Drivers can collect anywhere from $20 to $150 an incident by reporting damages to Uber.  (or more, if a professional help is needed and there is a receipt.)  The driver needs to submit a photo evidence directly to Uber. The cleaning fees are charged back to the offending customer.Fabrication:In some scams, the Uber driver simply makes up an incident by reporting food spills or bodily fluids soiling the car.  Since a photo is required, the driver would create an artificial mess and snap a pic.   Some are known to simply submit a photo they find on the Internet.  (Some drivers have shared with us that fake barfs and water bottles are used to make up a mess.)Exaggeration: In some cases, the passengers do make some mess.  Some drivers take advantage of this by artificially making the mess bigger or simply exaggerating it on the claims form to Uber.  There are four levels of cleaning fees, and if they can bump it up, they can earn more money. (related:How much are cleaning fees? - 4 Levels)Why does this work?This scam often works for multiple reasons.  One common reason is that the passenger may not notice they were charged the fee. Uber is extremely simple to use, where a credit card is automatically charged and the receipt is sent to the Inbox.  Many people do not bother checking those receipts or the amount charged.  If you do not notice?  The driver just got away.The passenger may also not remember the incident clearly, and it can become the driver's word against passenger's word.  If you fell asleep or were intoxicated, you may not remember well and you may have a difficult time arguing and making your case to Uber.   This can also happen when there are multiple passengers where the person who was charged cannot remember if a friend had made a mess.When a driver exaggerates the damage, it is difficult to catch for the passenger.  For example, if you spilled your drink, it may have been a simple clean up at $20.  However, the driver can claim a larger damage, say on the upholstery, where a professional cleaning was performed at $80.How to avoid and what to do when you suspect a scam.As a passenger, you want to be diligent by reviewing every Uber receipt to make sure a fake cleaning fee was not assessed.  If you indeed created a mess, you want to check whether the charge is fitting of the damage caused.  Take a look at the different cleaning fees assessed:How much are cleaning fees? - 4 Levels.If you do suspect a fraud/scam, you want to contact Uber immediately and make your case. In some cases, Uber will send you the photo of the incident that the driver uploaded.  Is it really the mess you made?Related Threads:-How is Uber fighting back against Cleaning Fees Scams?-Banned from charging Uber cleaning fee?ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Dec 24, 2018"

He also told me it would cost $200 for the oil change I said (WHAT??) he said yeah he would have to take off the exhaust system and running board to get to the filter. Changing the rear tire was $60. I was looking at about $500. After watching a few YouTube videos about the subject I called the mechanic back and gave him a piece of my mind.I told him he must be confused. I then went on to explain tool by tool what it would take to change the oil. The oil plug took a 17mm box end wrench. The outside cover was three 4mm hex bolts.

When I took it in for it's scheduled oil change they had it back in the bay for about 5 minutes and came out into the lobby with a print out for me with a $10,000 quote stating that the timing chain was shot and needed to be replaced immediately! Come on now.... I am no mechanic, but I was raised around them and I am no dummy! If my timing chain was shot, first and foremost, I would be hearing some sort of noise.

Is Uber eats worth it for drivers?,"ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLC",ippei1202Ube,IsUbereatswo,"DependsI will let other drivers on the forum answer this, but here are some comments:Are you a driver looking for more gigs? Then sure.Drivers can receive both ride requests and food delivery requests on the same shift. Therefore, drivers can keep busy by accepting both regular requests and Uber EATS requests.  It is a good way to increase the incoming requests.Are you a driver who is already keeping busy with rides?If the driver's shift is already busy picking up regular rides, he or she may opt out of Uber Eats requests that has a different pay scale.  The rates are calculated in a similar fashion to regular rides but they are different.  Drivers have to do the math which job to focus their shift on.Is it worth the hassle? Gotta watch pickup/delivery policiesSee, the time is of the essence to a Uber driver.  Unlike regular rides, the drivers need to consider for the time lost during pickups and making the deliveries. Every market has a different policy but some instruct the drivers to go to the doors for pickup/delivery while some encourage customers to meet the driver curbside. This definitely will play into the drivers preferring UberEATS.UPDATE:We had a few drivers share with us that Uber Eats requests are usually short-distance trips, always less than a few miles. Since drivers are getting paid for the time/distance driven, they do not make that much money on each request, and when considering the time spent on picking up and dropping off, it seems this is a less desired Uber service by the drivers.ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Mar 25, 2018"

Again the total time spent was 45 minutes to make $5.75. That was the good part.The delivery was to a hi-rise. I called the guy and told him the food was here. He said, ""I'm on the seventh floor, bring it up"". He said it was required by Uber. I had no idea if that was true at that time. I believe Uber is advertising door to door delivery now.I locked the car and took a smelly bag of burgers up a smelly elevator and knocked on the door. A half dressed guy reaches out and takes the bag and closes the door.I got out of the building safely and my car was not vandalized.Did I get a worthwhile tip? Yes, I will never take an UberEats again.If you deliver in the suburbs, I doubt if you'll make $10 an hour, but at least you will be safe.Read less..."

I had to wait 15 MINUTES FOR THE FOOD because the disorganized crew at the Taco Bus didn't have their act together. Didn't get paid a cent to wait for the food (which I knew in advance). This isn't the first time this has happened. I rarely get a tip when I do this service (tho' the out of town tourists tend to be much more generous than the locals). So as soon as I could I turned off the Uber Eats requests. Does the food talk back or ever act dangerous? Nope. But customers sure pay a lot more, and they (usually) don't stink up my car.

So driver could only wait in one place and saved the time for driving to restaurant, and don't need to worry about orders, because there are enough 'take away' restaurants for him."

you experienced any of these?If you are a passenger, don't get any ideas.  Uber and Lyft are putting more and more countermeasures in place, and drivers are quick to catch on.(source:RSG- The Rideshare Guy)1) Dropping the Pin Outside of a Surge ZoneIt didn’t take long for passengers to figure out this one.  Since surge and prime time zones are very localized, one street could be 2x and another could be 1.5x or even regular pricing.  What some passengers will do is move the pin around until they get out of a surge zone and then make their request.  At that point, they’ll either call the driver and let them know their real address or wait for the driver to pick them up and tell them “the GPS must be wrong”.I’ve been noticing this hack with greater frequency over the past few

fee.  I’ll also turn on my other app at this point and try to get another request during that 5 minute waiting period.2) Dropping the Pin Outside of Airport PremisesThis is a slight variation of the above hack but since there is a geo-fence around some airports, a lot of passengers have figured out that you can just drop the pin outside of the geo-fence (where lots of drivers are waiting) and then request that the driver come into the terminal and get you.There is no risk for the passenger with this strategy but the driver could face fines and possible impound if they get busted.  Lyft and Uber have been very good about covering fees in this situation but I’ve heard that they are going to slowly phase out that policy.  So drivers beware.How to Avoid: Don’t go into the airports (unless pick-ups are ok at your local airport) to pick anyone up.  Let the passenger know why you can’t come get them, ask them to cancel the ride and take a shuttle outside the airport (and don’t forgot to tell them to tip the shuttle driver a $1 or $2 for the ride3) Lyftjacking Or Uberjacking (Stealing other people's rides)I’ve readlots of storiesabout this one happening to unsuspecting drivers and it basically involves a passenger trying to steal someone else’s Lyft or Uber ride.  These ‘hackers’ will sometimes just get into your car if they see trade dress and let you know where they’re going.  5 minutes later you’ll get a call from your real passenger asking “Where the F are you going?!”  At this point, you’re in a tough situation because you’ve already started the trip on the wrong person and now you have someone in your car who you’re going to have to let out.  Just make sure that you’re as diplomatic as possible if this happens and e-mail support ASAP once you end the ride.How to Avoid: I always ask the passenger to confirm their name instead of saying, “Hey are you Steve?”  Especially during surge times orat the end of an eventwhen there are lots of people looking for their rides, it’s imperative that you find the right person.  I also turn on my flashers and try to make it easy for the right passenger to find me.4) Uber/Lyft RaceThere are some passengers who will call an Uber and a Lyft at the same time and take whichever car arrives first.  I know because this has happened to me before as a driver.  I pulled up at a location and saw passengers getting into another driver’s car and shortly after, the ride was cancelled.Uber and Lyft need to do a better job of punishing riders who cancel or abuse the system.  I don’t think there are many passengers that do this but it would be nice to see some repercussions for people who take advantage of drivers like this.5) Canceling A Trip During The RideI’ve never personally experienced this but I’ve talked to many drivers who have had passengers cancel the trip halfway through or even as soon as the ride begins.  If drivers aren’t looking at their phone, then they might not even know that this has happened until they get to the destination.How To Avoid: I always use the GPS on my phone to navigate even if I am pretty sure where we’re going.  That also means that I’ll see a cancellation notification/text every time I glance at the phone.  Just make sure that you don’t do it while you’re driving.The above is 5 out of the 10 from Harry's article.  Read morehere.Read less..."

5 Passenger / Rider Scams that Game the System - Drivers watch out!,Bigfrank,4954,5Passenger/R,If a passenger cancels a trip at any point while in the car that is called theft of services which is a crime. I would immediately tell them that I will call 911 t immediately if I don't see make cash or a credit card to pay the unpaid mileage.  Secondly all drivers should Always keep your navigation On regardless if a passenger tells you another way or you know a better way. With your nav on you will know if these scumbags cancel for a freebie.
5 Passenger / Rider Scams that Game the System - Drivers watch out!,BeMatt,1557,5Passenger/R,"This is more gaming Uber (the company), but if I have a ton of free promos, I will have my driver only drive me part of the way to my destination then stop the ride, then request again (while staying in the car), have the driver ""pick up"" my ride and start a ""new"" trip. I will do this a few times throughout the Uber trip to get virtually free rides instead of only getting one $5 amount off of a $20 ride."
5 Passenger / Rider Scams that Game the System - Drivers watch out!,amcbeth,8619,1557,"This post is interesting. I wonder if the driver would get paid less when making 5 short trips rather than one long trip?I had a rider that I knew in siiting in my car. We were going to the airport.He insisted on doing the right thing and requested the ride through Uber. To our surprise he got another driver. Why, I don't know. He canceled and requested again and got me.I say this because, this could happen to the rider with many promos.I wouldn't go for this myself. You might turn a 20 minute trip into a thirty minute trip."

I truly believe Uber instructs CS to give us wrong answers or hires dumbasses to give us wrong answers so we get fed up and stop asking for our money.  A week later had another ride on Lyft a scheduled trip. Rider insisted I take different route and also called Lyft because price changed from quote. She also changed address from original one although it was not much further. Lyft did back me on this one and refused to change price. Drivers just beware when riders ask you to take a different route. I now screenshot all routes that i intend to take (Waze). If rider tells me to take different route than GPS  I notify Uber or Lyft immediately following trip. I've also heard of a driver through another driver that she was deactivated after 3 riders reported she took longer routes in one month. She claims she followed GPS. She fought it and did get reactivated. True or not I dont know but I know what I just dealt with so just beware.Read less...

I have a few rides people ordered Uber X seen I had bigger car and had friends jump in. Some even cancelled their Uber because it was taking too long. Sure go ahead fill all 7 seats because as soon as I drop you off I am sending message to Uber and getting XL fare. I usually wait to send message until next morning after they tip as I know most likely they rated me then. Not only do I get til and 5 stars but get increase in fare. Had a group of really obnoxious guys tell me they purposely order Uber X and cancel before fee kicks in until they get bigger car. I took them they tipped me 10.00 cash, gave me 5 stars and exited. Figured they tipped because I took them when there was 5 and didnt complain. Next time they checked app they were in for big surprise. Stop trying to screw drivers to save a few bucks."

Can Uber and Lyft Fully Recover from the Pandemic? [RideshareGuy],SmittenKitten,CanUberandLy,0,"From the RideshareGuy:Uber and Lyft have been offering drivers big incentives to hit the road, mainly because of the driver shortage, but is that enough to entice drivers to return to the platform?One of my biggest concerns for the rideshare industry is the yo-yo effect on drivers: drivers returning to the platform or joining it for the first time, making good money, then having demand dry up due to shutdowns nationwide.If that happens too many times, fewer drivers will see rideshare driving as a viable option to earn extra income - and that will really spell problems for the rideshare industry.Here’s what readers are saying:Jerri shares a common sentiment among drivers: not wanting to return to rideshare due to too many concerns about unvaccinated and potentially sick passengers:“I'm slowly getting back to doing food delivery. At this point I'm not sure if I'm going back to regular Uber with all the rate and vaccine issues.”Another driver believes the shortage can be attributed to people having more money and not necessarily needing to drive:“It's almost like the 40% of the market that was doing this gig before Covid now don't have a reason to get back in. Rising home prices and stock portfolios hmmm.”https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/can-uber-lyft-fully-recover-from-pandemic-rideshare-drivers-campbell/"

[RideshareGuy],ClancyJones,19737,CanUberandLy,"well, since you asked...  no.  they will not recover.They could never finish off the taxi industry.  There are regulations coming, like work hours, driver benefits, and price regulations, and we will all revert back to the days of taxis.I mean it's already happening. Accountability of drivers, registered and properly insured vehicles, etc. That's how they issue taxi medallions."

Why does the public not feel it necessary to tip Ride Share drivers?,fpressly,Whydoesthepu,0,"When Uber first began, it made the ride “all inclusive”. In fact they made great effort to tell people they didn’t have to tip. Fast forward years later, when the greed of Uber/Lyft and their distribution of the ride share monies became so dismal, first Lyft then Uber added the tipping to the app. It was an effort to give the driver more money without it taking from their revenue.I don’t know why people are so hesitant and chintzy when it come to tipping Uber/Lyft drivers. They willingly tip taxis, hairdressers, restaurant wait staff, doormen, ushers, pool guys, delivery people (and on and on…) but not Uber/Lyft drivers. I don’t get it. Thank you for your upvote."
Why does the public not feel it necessary to tip Ride Share drivers?,Wes,8394,Whydoesthepu,"First, as many have stated, the original Uber had great rates for the drivers and tipping really wasn't necessary.  They advertised that and folks loved it.But beyond that is the reality that millenials HATE tipping.  I've had SO MANY 20/30 somethings tell me ""I just wish they would raise the rates, because I hate tipping""....  and that speaks volumes about the swing of attitude in our society as a whole.It's also really ""easy"" to not tip.  We've all experienced the ""I'll tip you on the App"" comment when in reality less than half of those that say it really do follow through.  Why waste your breath!!!  LOL.  But it demonstrates several things, not the least of which is Uber's failure to make the tipping function abundantly clear and difficult to avoid.  Let's be honest, we can't ""not rate"" a passenger - the app won't allow it.  But it DOES allow the passengers to not rate us ... just close the app and it will time out eventually and wor…Read more...First, as many have stated, the original Uber had great rates for the drivers and tipping really wasn't necessary.  They advertised that and folks loved it.But beyond that is the reality that millenials HATE tipping.  I've had SO MANY 20/30 somethings tell me ""I just wish they would raise the rates, because I hate tipping""....  and that speaks volumes about the swing of attitude in our society as a whole.It's also really ""easy"" to not tip.  We've all experienced the ""I'll tip you on the App"" comment when in reality less than half of those that say it really do follow through.  Why waste your breath!!!  LOL.  But it demonstrates several things, not the least of which is Uber's failure to make the tipping function abundantly clear and difficult to avoid.  Let's be honest, we can't ""not rate"" a passenger - the app won't allow it.  But it DOES allow the passengers to not rate us ... just close the app and it will time out eventually and work fine the next time you turn it on.It is shocking how many folks go to family style restaurants and leave little or no tips.  Just speak to a few waiters and you'll find out how crazy bad people can be.  And there's a LOT of folks that only care about themselves.  They expect 5 star service for a 1 star tip and quite frankliy don't ""care"" about how well you are or are not doing... just get them to their destination and see ya later!!!Read less..."
Why does the public not feel it necessary to tip Ride Share drivers?,brownbear,8357,Whydoesthepu,"Back when taxis ruled the world, tipping was completely standard. It was standard like tipping the waiter is. And it was really annoying. As a passenger you always had to make sure you had small bills with you to tip the driver.Uber was really innovative with their ""all inclusive"" thing, but I think you hit the nail on the head. They got greedy. This is why we can't have nice things."

Why does the public not feel it necessary to tip Ride Share drivers?,momof4,9901,8347,I''ve had 5 male riders who all said they were Uber/Lyft drivers. One of them tipped. Had 3 female riders who said their mom drives for Uber 2 tipped. You would think that they would be more apt to tip knowing what it's like out here. I guess not. I would be embarrassed to tell driver that I to drive and then not tip them.
Why does the public not feel it necessary to tip Ride Share drivers?,Jezzis,18448,8347,"I drive in Phoenix, so 40 minutes is pretty far (and thus pays really well because it will most likely be 25+ minutes on the highway here) so those types of rides I do not care about a tip as much. The ones that should tip 100% of the time are the ones take a ride that is 8 minutes on the road for 2 or so miles and pay the minimum of $2.62 for fifteen minutes of your time by the time you get to them and get them in the car (and in my experience these type of rides take the longest to arrive at your car for pickup as well).On the other hand, Lyft/Uber could fix that overnight by paying the drivers $0.50 a minute for wait time past the first minute or two of waiting for the pickup (also on scheduled stops for the whole stop time) and increasing the minimum ride pay to $5. It would not make the system perfect, but would come a long way to making the platform more fair for drivers' time and only increase prices significantly for 5-10% of riders."
Why does the public not feel it necessary to tip Ride Share drivers?,RPaulson,8376,Whydoesthepu,"Uber set the expectation with the  “cashless experience” and “our own private driver”. That’s the new bar that was set a while back.At best, they reset the expectation (ie eliminated th 15-20% for taxis) by introducing  their tipping feature where no one knew how much to pay and suggestions were to tip like 1-3 dollars regardless of what the trip was."
Why does the public not feel it necessary to tip Ride Share drivers?,bc88,13783,Whydoesthepu,"Studies show rather than from taxis most U/L  most passengers come from public transit, biking, walking or they would have skipped the trip, none of which include tipping.

$100 mcdonalds order - it happened,AsStibelDude,19868,19858,"I actually remember seeing the 200 burgers and being not that impressed.  You can fit like 20~30 burgers in a single brown bag, and a few of those would be in a larger plastic bag with handles.  A couple of guys would be able to carry them all.The location was very cool about it and after a few times, they started expecting it. We would call and they'd tell us to come pick them up at a certain time. (No online orders back then.) I think we used to give them 2 hours or something.Seeing how this was never an issue for the stores, we feel like we learned important lessons:- Those McDonald's store freezers store heck of a lot more than 200 patties and buns. They must have 1000s delivered at once.- The world is a big place. Thinking how many customers visit a single location in a day (plus the drive-thru), we realized they must serve 100s of burgers (maybe even 1000+) a day during those lunches and dinner times. Ordering 200 didn't even faze them."

I almost left her ass there but because I was taking a class I needed for Nursing (Interpersonal Communication)I waited. I did however confront her nicely and tell her her attitude and behavior were unacceptable and rude. She did apologize and promise me 5 stars. I really wanted to say, ""stick your 5 stars to your pasties and pluck some bills from your skanky g string"". Then I remembered where the g string lies and thought better of it.I have 1357 trips, (only 1 report for nav 3 days into my 1st week of driving) mind you GPS's fault added 20 secs to trip.I maintain a 4.93 to 4.95 rating 475 5 star trips.  Last and certainly not least. The rider ( I cannot figure out which one) who reported me for car being dirty and bad odor and apparently (according to email from Uber)I needed to shower.  This pops up as a report a few weeks ago while driving on a Friday night. I lost it. I cancelled my rider pulled over and sent Uber some of the most nastiest emails to date (trust me I have sent some pretty bad ones) I was shocked when I was able to get back on the app  in the morning. I thought for sure I would be deactivated. I sent screenshots of my car, pics of the air freshners I use. I do not since the 6th grade leave my home unless I am showered, hair washed daily, make up on and clothes are never worn more than once before they are washed. My kids think I am OCD when it comes to wash and cleaning. My clothes have to smell like fabric softner when I put them on or they go back into the wash. Lol I will also mention I use deodorant. I am in Nursing school which thry dont tolerate bad hygeine and I work in hospital where I cant smell either.  I wouldve been less angry if they reported I was falling alseep at the wheel (although I dont do that either). I was so furious I retired for the night after 3 rides. Texting this story is making me angry all over again. Lol I went back and forth with Uber for about 7 emails from me 3 from them. How dare they believe 1 rider report assume they are telling the truth. I hope their dumb simple minded asses didnt refund this piece of shit rider. There was more bad language used. Language I never use.  Dont think its a good idea to put certain words up on this site lol They email me back saying they dont always believe rider especially since there are no other reports but they are just trying to help me with telling me what rider said and give me suggestions. Wait you just said you didnt necessarily believe them but now your suggesting air freshner and better hygiene again. I finally gave up. Told them what I thought about rider, report, and their responses and called it a night. Nothing has pissed me off more than thst night. So wish I knew who it was. I had no issues with any rider other than the foot fetish guy who wanted to know about my shoes and a guy who said he left his cheap throw away cell in my car which was not in my car (I even checked gas station/mini mart I took him to to make sure they didnt have it).I had few rides that week and only drove 2 days.

They both passed out during the 3 mile ride. When we pulled up I was able to wake the guy easily. It took a little more to wake the female up. First words out of her mouth was ""did you tip her"" to which the male mumbled yes and kept saying ""come on lets go"". The female still somewhat half asleep asked again ""did you tip her""? Now he was getting annoyed. Did the cheap jerk think I couldnt hear her asking or him lying? Hello you are right behind me, I speak English, not deaf, and not stupid. This was worse then ""I'll tip you in the app"". What a cheap, rude, a#&hole. Hopefully she isnt married to this idiot and realize what a jerk he really is."

In a city like Chicago there a many alternatives to the private vehicle and almost all are more convenient, affordable, and relaxing. I can think of few less productive or more wasteful and depressing modes of commute than sitting in gridlock twice a day, an hour or two each way.In the last few years companies like Zipcar and iGo have presented alternatives to private car ownership. Rent a car for errands, then park and walk away. Simple. The proliferation of ride-sharing services like Lyft, Uber X, and Hailo also point to a new enthusiasm for escaping from the “freedom” of being shackled to one's own vehicle. Drivers want to be compensated for being stuck with these hunks of metal and who can blame them? The Divvy bike-sharing program has, by most accounts, been a big success and new bike lanes seem to appear around the city every other week. All these developments point to a tidal shift in how residents think about getting around their city.One of the key benefits and pleasures of city life is the chance to interact with others. The private automobile is antithetical to that idea. It's a closed environment which only comes into contact with other similarly closed environments when they conflict. A traffic jam is rarely the place to make friends. Cars are mainly obstacles to other cars. This is not to say that pedestrians and bicyclists spend their days dancing jigs and spoiling one another with group hugs but that when they near one another there aren't yards of metal, plastic and glass separating them. As unpleasant as an overcrowded city bus may be, it's certainly less alienating than thousands of vehicles on a highway, each with one occupant, each going their own way.They say that forward-thinking industrialists are investing in driverless vehicles and they can't get here fast enough for my taste. I can't wait to relinquish the control, but also the stress, worry and expense that comes along with my car keys. Any time I leave the house and take the Metra or the CTA rather than the car, the world feels like a lighter and more enjoyable place to be. With all the alternatives available these days, I hope never to buy my own automobile again. A car-free future would be a beautiful future indeed.Read less..."
My Post-Driving Life [Dmitry Samarov],KSkon,5659,MyPost-Drivi,"Similar experience.  I grew up in the Bronx and heavily leveraged the bus and subway.  Never had money to take a taxi, and took the Greyhound or Amtrak out of town maybe twice a year. Only a few of my friends' parents had a car, and I rode on it a few times, but I can count the times in both my hands.  That was my childhood.Oh, one more tidbit.  My dad's friend was a private taxi owner with a TLC license.  When my family needed a car (say to go on vacation to upstate or needed to pick up a furniture), we literally borrowed his taxi.  I do remember feeling a bit self-conscious when my father and I would pull up at events (say a concert), furniture store or a friend's house, in a NYC taxi, and it wasn't because I hired it there.  All is good though, because I never felt that emberassed because everyone I knew didn't have access to cars either.Then again, being in NYC, we were always reminded of people with better lives with nice cars and enough money to take taxicabs. :)"
My Post-Driving Life [Dmitry Samarov],RedANT,5658,MyPost-Drivi,"I find freedom in having a car, (I have 4, 2 strictly for work, and 2 for personal use) because it allows me to go where I want, when I want, without having to rely on 3rd parties.  If I want to grab something from the store, I get in the car and go, then get back in and return home.  No playing with an app, waiting for a filthy vehicle to pick me up, waiting at the store for another vehicle to stop  by, and paying multiple fees for it.IMO, self driving vehicles will usher in a new era of technology dependence, and the end of personal freedom.  Regardless, self driving cars are a very long way off, and certainly won't ever take hold during my lifetime."
My Post-Driving Life [Dmitry Samarov],Peterthebull,5664,5658,"While I agree with your points on why I would feel ""free"", I fall in the camp of someone who drives into the city sometimes spending 1 hour each way.  I don't want to do it but i have to, and I do feel trapped.  Then once I am downtown, I gotta do something about the car. I have to stress over where to park.  I first look at street parking, sometimes park little outside the city and take the subway in, and sometimes I pay $30. The car becomes a liability and a huge baggage.  I've even thought about buying a motorcycle but my wife doesn't let me. (she's afraid I will kill myself. probably a sound advice as I am not that coordinated)So I don't feel that free anymore when I look at it in this light."

(D)1⭐️The driver made me late to work! Or an Express Pool passenger, the driver didn’t take me to my address. I got dropped off at an intersection! (F)"
Explaining the rating system,DougH,7807,Explainingth,Very accurate. I try to do my part by telling friends that anything less than 5 is basically signaling that the driver should be fired.
Explaining the rating system,KristenJanetKim,7829,7807,"Yeah, if all you ever got was 4 stars, you would be deactivated."
Explaining the rating system,MaryIST,13409,7807,"Oh, boy.  Are you sure this is really the case? I have never wished upon a driver he be fired but I have given some four-star ratings. I am starting to feel real bad for this. I thought I was being constructive to be honest."
Explaining the rating system,DougH,13430,13409,"I wouldn't really worry about it. It would take a lot of 4-star ratings to badly harm the driver's overall rating. If there was a pretty major issue, 4-stars or less is appropriate. I usually only downrate for safety problems, or extreme unprofessionalism."
Explaining the rating system,RIDEINFO,19014,7807,"This is true.  Some people give lower ratings just because they don't want to give a 5, even if there was nothing wrong with the ride."
Explaining the rating system,KristenJanetKim,8040,Explainingth,"I got 1 star at the end of July when I had to end a ride early because the destination filter failed to give me a ride going my direction. I went from 4.86 to 4.85. Today I just went back to 4.86, but it took over a month for me to go back up by 0.01! Less than half of my trips are rated.

Explaining the rating system,KristenJanetKim,8238,8226,I often check my ratings right after a passenger gets dropped off. I got it immediately after the ride ended and it was my first 3-star rating.
Explaining the rating system,duckdomination,9225,8040,"Yup.  The only less than 5 stars I have gotten are due to Lyft app issues.  I’m currently 4.99 due to the app sending me around the block with 3 riders yesterday.  I complained to Lyft and they blew me off and said “focus on the positive”. Nah, I’ll focus on driving for uber."
Explaining the rating system,KarinaWakaba,8089,8040,"Less than half?  I rate every one of my rides. I mean, it's in my face the next time I open the app, and I rate it so I can get rid of the screen."

Anything that's not a driver or a car issue, then only a five star counts, anything less is not counted against you. I'm a 4.93 and about 74% rate me, meaning in reality 26% of people had a bad ride with me but Uber took the blame because they selected a none driver issue."
Explaining the rating system,Bigfrank,7884,Explainingth,Stars are for children in kindergarten and for adults who act like kindergarten children.
Explaining the rating system,KristenJanetKim,7886,7884,"LOL! Why can’t the rating system be like UberEats, thumbs up or down? Thumbs up, you would want that driver or passenger again. Thumbs down, no. Then the driver would need to maintain a minimum percentage of thumbs up to stay active. For UberEats it’s 85%."
Explaining the rating system,amcbeth,8225,7886,"1. Has anyone ever calculated what they make on UberEats? I have, thumbs down.2. What is the difference between adding Thumbs and the current rating system.I would imagine most of the customers for UberEats would give a thumbs down and the rest wouldn't rate.I also think Uber would never let a driver go that does UberEats, there are so few."
Explaining the rating system,KristenJanetKim,8239,8225,"I currently have 95%. The app says you need to maintain 85% in order to keep delivering with UberEats. Pay is lousy. I average $6 per delivery (vs. $10 per delivery with DoorDash). But the advantage is the trips are usually short and it’s a good way to get to your Quest bonus faster, not to mention it’s a restroom break. Plus I’ve discovered a lot of great restaurants for myself this way."
Explaining the rating system,SteveBausch,13411,7886,Is this true that UberEats only offer Thumbs up and Thumbs down?
Explaining the rating system,jeremyalastor,7988,7886,"I didn't realize that this is how Uber eats does ratings. So much easier. Come on Uber, you already do this on one of your platforms, it would be so easy to implement!"
Explaining the rating system,KristenJanetKim,8000,7988,"The current system of rating is so flawed because passengers don’t understand it. I even gave a driver 3 stars once because he had a hard time finding me in spite of calling me. This was before I became a driver. Now I realize it’s often not the driver’s fault because Google Maps or Waze may take the driver to an alternate entrance, or may have the wrong address to begin with."
Explaining the rating system,GundamX10,8460,8000,"Yes, but it's still the fact that he was late and couldn't find you.  He can't just blame the technology, and it still reflects on his overall ability to pick up passengers.  An experienced driver may have beenThe rating shouldn't just be about the intention or the blame, or else any nice driver will have prefect scores.  It should be on a person's ability as a rideshare driver."
Explaining the rating system,SteffGart24,7811,Explainingth,"Very nice.  This needs to be placed in every doctor's office.  I mean in every Uber cabinI disagree on one thing though.  Passenger's take on 1-star?  I think that's more for- ""My driver was drunk"" or- ""Dropped me off in  middle of a highway.or, my favorite- ""I just didn't like the guy."""
Explaining the rating system,KristenJanetKim,7828,7811,There are a lot of reasons a passenger may give 1 star. I got 1 star because a passenger was 5 minutes late to work and blamed it on me. It was also a Pool with 2 other passengers on board. I also got 1 star because the destination filter failed to give me a ride going my direction. I had to ask the 2nd Pool passenger to get another Uber because he was going the opposite direction I was. I had a kid ride scheduled and you can’t cancel a kid last minute. I bet the guy got another Uber within minutes. I also got a fare adjustment because he probably complained and asked for a refund.Another time I got a police officer as a passenger. It was literally a 1-mile ride. I got 3 stars from him. The only mistake I made was not turning in the correct driveway for his hotel. I corrected it. Nobody was in any kind of danger. I felt that was an unfair rating.
Explaining the rating system,SteffGart24,7891,7828,"Why can't we all just get along.  Empathize with each other, and help each other out.  We are all in this together.  Such a bummer that the dude gave you one-star for that.The police officer probably just thought 3 was ""normal"".  People in those professions (like military) don't sugarcoat things, and I bet he probably thought he was giving ""average."""
Explaining the rating system,RIDEINFO,19013,7811,"So true.  I get riders who take their time getting to the car,then want me to break speed limits because they are late for work.  Has nothing to do with how long it took me to get to them.  Also, Uber often sends you to a ride 15-20 minutes away.  Cant believe there is no one closer.  The rider gets mad because it took you that long to get there,"

At the time I didn’t know what that was. I think I have it now, but nobody has asked about it since. I still gave him 4 stars. I do have an aux cable, which has only been used a few times."

More important are the written comments people have taken the time to make. Giving star ratings is a momentary off the cuff reaction. Written comments take time and thought.I think the driver and the rider should have two choices, 1. I WILL ride with this person again. 2. I WILL NOT ride with this person again. Then let the computer do the rest to match appropriate combinations of rider/driver. Either you are willing to deal with this person again or you are not. That is all that should matter. If enough drivers say they will not deal with a rider that rider is banned. If 20–25 riders in a certain time frame say they won’t ride with this driver again; sorry bro, we got to investigate that. 25 strangers can’t all be liars. Time for corrective measures.While I am at it, I would like to mention to those of you who are interested in driving for Uber or Lyft and are enticed by the bonuses for signing up and delivering a certain number of rides in a set time frame. Beware. Make sure the geographic area where you are working IS ABLE TO DELIVER THE NUMBER OF CALLS NECESSARY for you to achieve that goal (factor in the saturation of drivers in that city). When I first signed up for Lyft in Greenville SC I was only getting 3–4 calls a day (in an afternoon six hour shift) and didn’t even get close to enough rides for the sign on bonus. Still unsure if that was low demand or if Lyft was choking back my ridership so I could not make bonus.Adding Uber boosted me to 25 calls a day. 25–30 rides a day is average. During a Clemson home game, my busiest day ever, in one 24 shift I delivered 58 rides. My best day was $850. The rider, on a long haul, agreed to pay twice the Uber for an empty return and gave me a $100 tip. It was a 12 hour excursion.Thanks for your upvote.Read less..."

Why does Lyft make it so hard to tip?,GreatBallOfFire169,WhydoesLyftm,0,"I took a Lyft ride to the airport.  I will admit, I don't use Lyft that often (especially during this pandemic).

Drivers are not always aware of the user experience, so this is good to know. (not like we can do anything about it)Basically, this restricts any occasional riders from tipping. Why would the open the app again if they only need a ride once a month?"
Why does Lyft make it so hard to tip?,DDominico69,19631,WhydoesLyftm,"Right, that's the problem with this. Most casual riders do not use Lyft app enough to be prompted to rate and tip the driver. It's usually too late by the time they see the email receipt or whatever.  The Lyft app should pop up a notification to encourage this.  Many want to tip and this shouldn't be the reason people shouldn't tip.  This hurts everyone."
Why does Lyft make it so hard to tip?,CWalcutt75,19632,19631,I wonder why Lyft even applies a duration.  Is there some law against this? Charging a customer x days later?  Maybe a restriction enforced by the credit card company?  why why why?

One of the workers says that the car at the pump has been there for awhile with a female sleeping. So I walk over and there is a young 20 something girl passed out with head back mouth open. I cant see her chest rise and fall and color doesnt look good. I pound on the car window no response. I tell the clerk to call 911. I try the door which luckily was unlocked.I feel for pulse which is thready and irregular. I check her breathing her respirations are 4 per minute. I try shaking her no movement. She has glass pipe in one hand lighter in the other and car has funny odor. I finally give her a sternal rub 3X. She finally opens her eyes and is very disoriented. I ask her if she is ok.

After you dry them thouroughly take a paper towel to shut spigot off. Use a paper towel to open door because trust me SOME PEOPLE DONT WASH AT ALL, SOME INCORRECTLY, AND SOME FOR 5 SECS.  After you have washed correctly and you dont use a paper towel to turn off spigot and open door you wasted your time its like you never even washed your hands.

Those legally prescribed drugs led him and his family into a years long nightmare that finally ended with his sad, pointless death on the floor of his parents' bathroom. He left a wife and two young kids behind.Drug companies pushed these drugs, deliberately downplaying the addictive qualities of them. I find it hard not to blame them squarely for this problem. Once these drugs get a hold of you they don't let go, ever, and these companies knew it all along.It's just a horrible situation all around. A true crisis.

If I overdose while trying to help the one who overdosed  who will help me?Sometimes I stop to help ladies in freeway with flat tires, but if I feel the stretch of road is not safe (not enough room to change the tire due to shoulder being too narrow, especially on driver side) I will pass.

At the end of the day though if I come across someone who is not breathing and has no pulse and I have access to Narcan that would save them could I walk away? The answer is no. No matter how I feel about whats fair, whats not, and what these people are doing to themselves, family, and society I could not watch someone die if I had the means to save them.  Other people have their opinions and may not want to get involved and that is their right and I totally understand why.

I have personally met addicts that function in sociery and hold a job. There are addicts that lead a double life and go to work, have a family etc..  A drug user may snort or smoke it before they get into the Uber. You can OD on it by snorting, smoking, or injecting. Snorting can take up to 15 min to reach blood stream. It is very possible for them to order an Uber and OD 20 min after snorting it . Addicts that inject it die quicker because it goes directly to blood stream.What I have posted above is by no means to try and change how you feel about it.  I just wanted you to be aware that unfortunately it is possible especially in todays society.  Hopefully none of us ever have to experience it.

I carry a voltmeter in my car and jumper cables, so I can easily help someone jump start a car, test their battery or alternator, because I am confident and have the training. Imagine another driver carrying jumping cables in trunk, but has no idea how to hook them up and fries all your electronics while trying to do the right thing by jumping your car. I feel the same way about carrying Narcan as I would panic and have no idea what to do other than calling 911.Quoting my Automotive instructor: a $10,000 tool in a hands of an idiot, is a $10,000 tool in a hands of an idiot (that refers to me with Narcan) :)"
Heroin Epidemic. As an Uber driver would you be willing to carry Narcan in the event someone would Over Dose in your car?,momof4,9083,9070,I agree. I dont let anyone hook the cables up as I dont trust them. Narcan  can be adminitered via the nose in a spray. If you are to use it and the person didnt OD it wouldnt hurt them. It's not harmful and not addictive. Massachusetts put lock boxes on corners where most drug overdoses occur. When someone calls them about an overdose they instruct them how to get it out and what to do with it. PA and 38 other states by 3/2018 passed good samaritan laws regarding Narcan. Just like CPR. If you administer CPR you are protected against good samaritan laws.Not trying to change anyones views just sharing info. 😊

Of course they do not understand that you just saved their life, they only care about one thing ;)the more we discuss this subject here the more I am leaning away from administering anything, several articles popped up recently where first respondents had to be treated for OD like symptoms caused by them helping OD patients due to highly potent synthetic garbage people take these days.good post, made me think this through and come to a solid conclusion at least when it comes to me ;)"

I dont have the answers but someone needs to find them. If I had Narcan and seen someone that needed. I would probably give it. I just couldnt walk away knowing I could save their life. I totally respect that others wouldnt want to do it because you are right you dont know how they will react. This epidemic is awful.

I have an elderly relative who is on Tramadol. Tramadol is a synthetic Opoid pain medication. Apparently new rule (at least in PA) is,  any patient receiving an Opioid for pain relief is to be given a prescription for Narcan. It is up to the patient to fill the prescription but they are not forced to fill it. I guess as long as doctor, hospital, clinic gives them the script they are in the clear. The person was able to fill it at no cost, insurance covered it. They dont need it as they take the medication as directed so I ended up with it. I hope I never have to use it but if needed I can try to help. As I've said I want no part of watching someone die in my car if I can help. I have been in the healthcare field all my life as an MA and/or Tech. I currently attend Nursing school this is why I choose to carry it.

You pick up two riders with sunglasses, hoodies, baggy pants and ballcaps. Before the end of the block I hear the app tone for a route change and a scheduled stop.

They can take a different chauffeured vehicle every time they venture out and by the time anyone is wise (quick 5-6 stops over 20 minutes) and you are done.

They keep their eye sight straight ahead.They will try to distract you when you are gathering your belongings by talking to you - even if the entire ride they didn't.If they do forget your stuff, they know of people or place they can drive straight to that can take advantages of your credit cards and cell phones. There are plenty of those shady places in NYC where you can sell them quick."
"on drop-off, driver almost hit me and stole my belongings in one sweep",Gidget&Max,19466,19462,"My colleague forgot her purse in the back of a cab. She was freaking out at work until she got a call that said, ""I got your purse. Everything is fine. I will come meet you."" She was relieved.Then an hour went by.  Then another hour. She called back the number but no one answered.  That's when she realized (well, her colleagued emphasized) thatthe purse is long gone and the only reason they called was to make sure she didn't cancel the credit cards.Yep, 10s of charges at local stores on her credit cards. Amazing, eh?"
"on drop-off, driver almost hit me and stole my belongings in one sweep",bellylaugh,19458,"ondrop-off,d",That’s ridiculous! Can you message her through the app and say you are taking legal action?I would also spread this story on all social media so Lyft has to respond!
"on drop-off, driver almost hit me and stole my belongings in one sweep",jbauer,19463,19458,"The problem is that it's always their words against yours. Time and time again, the drivers just say they didn't see the belongings, and that usually ends the conversation. It's worse because passengers often aren't 100% sure what they did with the bag.  They often think, ""oh crap, where's my bag?  Did I leave it in the cab? No, I couldn't have.""  This is how a huge majority of people react. (I mean, no one thinks about it as they shut the door.)If they are cornered, they just say, maybe the next passenger took it? Yep. It's a standard line. cabbies know it."

For Uber, the price is for when the ride is scheduled. Surge applies as well.For UberNo, it does not guarantee your fare when you shedule them in advance.  Uber's Scheduled Rides are priced the same as any normal Uber ride and is determined at the time the ride is scheduled for.It is also based on demand at the time of the ride, hence if there is surge pricing, that multiplier will also apply to your fare.  Uber app will notify you of these changes when the scheduled request is dispatched.For LyftYes, they do guarantee the fare that you see when you scheduled your ride.  Hence you can ""lock"" in your rate, and this means that if there is higher PrimeTime surge pricing at the time of your actual travel, you will still pay the previously agreed fare.  (However, remember that Lyft can only be booked up to 7 days in advance and they may specify PrimeTime when scheduling.)Here's Lyfts statement:""We predict what Prime Time will be at the time you schedule your ride. When you confirm your ride request, Prime Time islockedat that rate. Even if Prime Time is higher or lower at the actual pickup time, your Prime Time amount is the same as the original estimate.""

How are you supposed to even get leverage at 6 inches? I think we have become a people of AAA reliants. My 328i doesn't even have a spare tire. Have a car problem, call a car service.Almost two weeks ago I was tooling down the highway and Waze told me there was a car ahead on the shoulder. As I approached I punched the Waze update that said the car was still here and slowed to assess the situation. It was a Toyota Corolla, probably 6 -8 years old, the brightest key lime pie green imaginable and with what had to be the largest African American woman I had ever personally seen, standing forlornly by a tire so flat it had come half way off the tire. I mean I don’t know how to exactly put it in words except to say SHE WAS BIG in allcaps. There may be larger women on TV but this was the largest I had ever seen with my own eyes. She was holding the little 6 inch lug wrench they give you, as though that were the culprit to her problem. Little did she know she would never get to the lug wrench portion of that affair. Her real problem was in the fact that the low profile tires she had, made it too low (with a flat) to get her OEM jack underneath it.  She would have been here a while. Without further discussion I saw the problem and moved to fix it. I backed the limo up jumped in the Corolla to lock the brakes and make sure it was in park. I felt like a kid in his Dad’s chair. The seat had been removed from it’s bolt downs and moved all the way back to the back seat and rebolted. The passenger side seat had also been moved back and shifted left. This essentially made two seats into one. There was no leg room for anyone in the back seat. The woman explained she sat in the middle of the front seat (one butt cheek per seat), drove with her left hand and shifted and did everything else with her right hand. I was amazed at the woman’s tenacity in wanting to be self-sufficient in transportation. Needless to say I made swift work of her tire change. The woman tried to tip me, but that would have taken away the pleasure of just doing a good deed for a person with an unsolvable problem. Just give them that little hand up, that little nudge.

Two min. go by pool ride request 4.5 rating 15 min. away, 3 more min go by pool request 20 min. away 4.5 rating. No one will pick this rider up.Not only did it go through all those drivers available but went back to me 3X. Finally some pay back to riders who treat drivers like crap! No one will pick this person up. Would love to know how long it took them to get driver to accept.. Probably a new driver picks him/her up and they say "" i dont understand I couldnt get anyone to take my request"" dont be a D Bag and treat people nice and maybe that wouldnt happen. It just felt good to finally see this happen. Uber wont have to deactivate, drivers are sticking together not tolerating bad behavior on crappy pool rides. Although person shoukd be deactivated with that rating.My happiness was short lived though. Now that I cant see my cancel or acceptance rate( although i dont think its that bad) think I am on some kind of time out or punishment. Not sure if its from that or from the class action suit I got 123.45 from a few days ago. Friday night averaged 38.50 an hr. had a long trip and a few good cash tips. Saturday and Sunday night awful.

"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",momof4,9507,8405,"If it's a surge with long pick up fee I take it. I've taken 3 surged rides with long pickup fee. Not only did I get surge but pickup fee wasnt bad. One was 20 min pick up got 7.90, 12 min got 6.45, and 10 min was 5.45 just for the long pick up."
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",momof4,8406,8405,Yes it is. Unless its a nice surge. Oh wait Uber lowered the surge amount. I wouldve loved to been standing next to the rider who ordered pool with the 4.5 that no driver would go pick up. Hopefully as they watched a bunch of other riders getting picked up in a few min at same location. Priceless
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",ChrisWeston,9440,8406,"I guess I don't know anything about what drivers go through. what do you mean tahey got rid of the surge? Sorry I don't drive, so I have no idea."
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",momof4,9459,9440,If you are in a busy area and there are not many drivers they increase prices (surge) to bring drivers to the area. Drivers make more money sometimes really good money. They still surge just not as good as it used to be. Suppy and demand. Although I always got pinged with long pick ups that were out of surge area so I dont miss what I rearely had:)
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",ChrisWeston,9504,9459,"Yeah I know what a surge is, but I wasn’t sure what it meant by no more surge. Just smaller amounts and multipliers?"
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",momof4,9506,9504,"Sorry I misunderstood. I didnt mean to post it the way I did its confusing. I will fix it. Yes, surge amount is lower.  The heat map comes up with an amount. Starts at 1.25 the most Ive seen here in Philly is 8.75 (only once) 2.00 to 5.00 seems to be the average.  Basically whatever the amount is you get it added to your trip  The only good thing is if we get to surged area but receive no trips you will get that on your next trip.  Regardless if there is a surge or not as long as you dont go off app or decline a ride. Unfortunately if a 10 min away pool wuth rider rating at 4.6 comes in you cant decline or you lose the surge. As you drive into surged area not only is heat map there but at bottom of screen it says what your minumum surge amount is as you travel into other streets it clumbs. I drive into streets that has the highest amount and wait. Once heat map disappears I can go wherever to get my next ride as that will be surged."
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",ChrisWeston,9532,9506,"No no. Thank you for the details and clarification!  You know your stuff!That’s interesting how the surge sticks with you. Not sure why such a rule exist, but hey why not. Keeps the drivers happy, I bet."
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",momof4,9536,9532,"This is just a guess. I know you get most of it just thought I would share my 2 cents on why it may exists :) The reason for surge is demand is high as you know. Drivers would head to the surged area only to get there and it was over or you got there waited for a ride and didnt get one. As riders figured surge out they wouldnt request rides until prices came down (surge dont last long unless really busy 5/10 min).  Everytime I was in surged area I would get pings for long pick ups out of surged area. I got few surged rides. With new surge if driver just makes it to the area surge stops within a min or 2 driver at least gets 1 ride with surged rates. Basically driver gets some compensation for travelling to that area.Tonight I got off I 95. Headed to get gas noticed the area which  I was headed to surged. Once I got to gas station surge was 1.25.

You just wasted time and maybe drove to area that you didnt want to be in or was now slow. At least now you get a surged rideShort guess:To give drivers something on new app that they advertised as ""we listened to drivers"" drivers helped with app"" make it seem they actually care about drivers.

"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",ChrisWeston,9629,9536,"That's neat that the surge kept creeping up, and you were able to keep it. (So you got a 8.25X surge? Wow.)I wonder what it's like from the eyes of a customer though. One can be in an area where there is no surge, but depending on where the driver came from he can be dinged with inflated prices.Also, does the surge earned by the driver stick forever? It must not. A customer shouldn't be dinged with a surge from an hour ago when the roads were busy. So many questions."
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",momof4,9647,9629,"I was wondering about that also. Next time I will look at the ride after the surge. See if rider pays or Uber takes loss. On the map you can see the amt. the closer you get to where the 8.25 (or whatever the amt. is) it keeps creeping up. It shows you the changes of surge amt. under the words ""finding trips"". I started at Knights & Frankford as I travelled it started saying minimum surge 1.25 (as I travel closer to that 8.25 it just keeps going up) 2.50 etc. I hit knights and fairdale 8.25 popped up. At that point I pulled over & sat. I did get a ride quickly. The other time I seen  3.25 going up Grant hit frankford by time I got to Knights surge was over. My next ride I did get surged amt. even though heat map was gone for 5 min. It is good but now ""chasing surge"" is what you end up doing :) I had no traffic on Knights Saturday night but I had to do 45 mph to get up to 8.25.  It sticks with you until you get your next ride as long as you dont cancel or turn app off.…Read more...I was wondering about that also.

No traffic so I could go somewhat faster. I tend to drive fast except when I have rider. You are correct 8.25 is the amount you get for that trip. Multiplier is no more :) I like it better as I rarely ever got a surged ride. Either just missed it or I would get a long pick up ping. I've been able to get more surged rides this way. As always Uber's figured another way to keep drivers on the road longer. If you were done for the night but your next trip is surged obviously you will take thst trip if its a good surge amt. I've only seen 8.25 2x since this started average is 3.50 to 4.50 at least up in my area. Certain areas in Philly are somewhat more but I dont like to drive in thise areas.:)"

"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",ChrisWeston,9439,8405,I am not a driver. What does that mean. Is that UberBlack?I assume that's what gets displayed when you get a ride request?
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",Wes,9591,9439,"No.  WE have no idea if you're a driver or not when a passenger request arrives.  UberBlack is limo service that is available in larger markets and the premium level of service.  Uber X is basic, Uber XL will generally seat 6 passengers, Uber Select is premium cars such as Audi, Bmw etc...  and Uber Black is limo.  There are also some markets with other options such as SUV which is typically an escalade or similar, and in selected markets there are other options such as Infant seat or underage passenger etc..."
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",ChrisWeston,9618,9591,Sorry. I’m thick headed. What does “Premium Pickup Possible?”Where does it get displayed and to whom? Drivers?
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",LG-PA,9639,9618,"Long pick up premium possible is displayed to driver when a request comes in for a fare that is say 15 minutes away, but it will only pay the extra pennies after driver drive a threshold distance which maybe 10 minutes, thus the remaining 5 minutes of the trip to get the passenger after driver eats the expense of driving first 10 minutes. The distance varies by market but long pickup premium fees are fairly low."
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",jknobson77,9464,Paybacksforb,The pay back is this:Uber passengers in Australia and New Zealand will get banned from the app if their rating drops below 4 stars
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",momof4,9469,9464,"Thats in Australia. They havent mentioned it in US yet :) Be nice if there were some repercussions. We go below 4.6 we are deactivated as a driver. We are replacable. Uber doesnt care how riders treat drivers.  Perfect example how rude and obnoxious some riders can be:Go to forumSelf Entitled and stupidity taken to whole new level. What does Lyft do? It's a long video 16 min but check it out. It's unbelievable that there are people like that among us. This person should be banned from Uber, Lyft, and any other ride share in US."
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",LG-PA,9538,9469,"Hidoes uber and Lyft state on their website that 4.6  for driver = deactivation?was coaching my uncle last night on how to be more efficient driver and noticed his uber and Lyft Driver rating is in 4.3 territoryhas several 1’s probably due to inexperience handling pool and shared rides.probably he is given a free pass as he is a fairly new driver.first thing I told him is stop accepting all pools and shared. Next, to pay close attention to passenger rating when (non shared, non-pool request comes in) ignore any with 4.7 and below.passengers,when a driver accepts your request so you see driver rating? If so do you use this to immediately cancel the ride if say a driver rating is 4.4? Just curious if passengers use rating system in same manner as drivers?"
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",momof4,9550,9538,"I am not sure if its on their site. I am sure its somewhere :) Everyone states it is a 4.6.

I can honestly say some of the riders I pick up I dont understand why their ratings are low. I have no issues with them other than they may not tip. I dont rate less than 5 stars for not tipping thats just me. Other drivers feel differently so your Uncle will have to decide. Out of 1475 I've never rated anyone below a 5. There has been a handful or 2 that I probably should have. No one has annoyed me that much :) I also stay away from dangerous neighborhoods. Obviously I have trips to these neighborhoods which I do drop off but I shut the app off until I get closer to my area. Streets are very small, trolley tracks, etc just too much stress not worth it. My experience is for the most part they dont cancel drivers for ratings. BTW I drive in Philadelphia and Bucks County. When I first started I knew nothing nor did I bother to look things up. I managed but I've learned a lot through sites like this and you tube videos lol. I watched them waiting for rides.I learned which ones were a waste and which ones were worth taking advice.  The only thing I disagree with is having water and snacks. Gum and mints are ok but also not necessary at leastbin my experience. Its recommended by some ride share bloggers, videos, etc... Had them in beginning. Anyone who took them which was rare never tipped, dont know about the ratings. I can tell you my ratings didnt get better or worse bit having them. BTW it was always pool people they took them and some for later. I guess it cant hurt though. If its real hot I have some water. Snacks and candy I do for holidays. Gum and mints isnt a bad idea. When I do have those I buy for myself. I offer to passengers that are nice. I can tell you chargers are great to have. I carry android, iphone, galaxy note 8 that has different chargers than all others. What works great is an aux cord riders love it. Had riders tip decent amounts. I also have you tube red 10.00 a month (think u can deduct on taxes but not 100% sure) I can play anything they want. I also create a few play list ex.rock, classic rock metal most of my riders like this one (even young ones) 80''s music, oldies 50's and 60's, rap(not hard core)young people post malone, wiz kalifa, chris brown,. I've got great tips for this also. Usually pays for itself. Thats what works for me here in Philly and Bucks. This site is great for getting ideas, suggestions, info  etc....Hope this helps. Once your Uncle drives more it should get better. Stay away from pool if possible. Now that I wrote you a novel hope something I posted helps and answers your questions. As you can see my answers are always long and probably more info than you wanted.  Lol If there is anything else feel free to ask. I'll answer as best as possible. Ippei and Lily are great at answering questions also. Air freshner helps also. Make sure car is clean and neat. This is what works for me here in Philly. Hopefully something will help your Uncle😊 Best of luck. Where does your Uncle drive???Read less..."

"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",LG-PA,9558,9554,Why are using Uber GPS at all? Waze is the way to go 100% rarely have issues using Waze
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",momof4,9565,9558,I have both up. Was in Center City a few weeks ago for an appointment. Waze and Maps were trying to take me down one way streets. I had compared Uber to Waze in beginning of trip they both had same directions to drop off today. Uber decided to re route back to streets we all ready were on in beginning of trip. Then Uber app froze and crashed. I had shut down Waze had to get it back up but was at greenlight with traffic behind no time. I ended up turning into hotel parking lot by city hall instead of not knowing which way to go or endangering passengers until I fixed issues.  Its CC traffic heavy around city hall people drive like idiots. I panicked. Lol I had 4 riders who were lets say somewhat snobby. You know the type they have money your just a driver who doesnt  matter.  it seemed like they were getting annoyed. Anyway would feel better if I could rely more on GPS.

Not sure how drivers use Waze, but I disable voice and turn by turn screens. I only have the map up and the banner on top that tells me in how many miles I am to take my next turn and onto what road.If you follow the map you can see the contour of the street you are driving on, you can count how many streets more until the one you need, etc.Read less..."
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",momof4,9612,9592,Thanks for the advice.  I know how to change a tire and seen many plugged but I can never get lugs off :)  AAA to the rescue. I was still in the mindset of keeping my acceptance rate up:) I also have been lucky this past month and I havent had trips to any of my least favorite areas.   This weekend was first weekend I didnt shut it off remembering acceptance rate didnt matter. Old habits die hard.

"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",LG-PA,9621,9615,"No worries at all!Forums like this, where drivers and riders share tips and traps are very good to learn what works for both (drivers and riders)I am always happy to read tips other drivers post and implement them to try out. They just become additional tools in my driving aresnal, such as to look out for scams where riders will try to cancel a ride mid-trip (this makes me a smarter and more alert driver). I had a scammer this week who dropped a pick up pin just outside the airport and then called me to say he was in terminal B, Guessing he avoided an airport pick up fee. This is illegal but I did not catch on to it right away, will be smarter next time. So the more tips shared the better we all become.

They just become additional tools in my driving aresnal, such as to look out for scams where riders will try to cancel a ride mid-trip (this makes me a smarter and more alert driver). I had a scammer this week who dropped a pick up pin just outside the airport and then called me to say he was in terminal B, Guessing he avoided an airport pick up fee. This is illegal but I did not catch on to it right away, will be smarter next time. So the more tips shared the better we all become. I fo example do not carry nor offer water, snacks, etc. If a passenger needs a napkin I have some tucked away in the back pocket of passenegr seat. I use them to clean windows. If they need a charger I offer them my as my phone is always at 100%. My rideshare phone is iPhone and personal is LG so I have both typs of chargers in the car. I try not to go out of the way too much as it may seem as I am trying too hard. Just give them a safe ride to their destination and chat wit them if they want to. I stick to basics :)Read less..."

"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",Wes,9595,9538,"It varies by market and that is directly from Uber.  There are some markets where a lower rating is acceptable becuase the prevailing attitude amongst passengers in those markets seem to be generally rate lower than in other markets.  I know from traveling as a passenger I've had drivers pick me up with 4.2 ratings which really surpised me and in conversation i could tell they were not a ""new"" driver.  Las Vegas was one of those markets and I'm often in Dallas, TX where it seems lower ratings are acceptable.  However in MOST markets it seems that 4.6 is the cutoff line.  I've heard that if an experienced driver gets that low they sometimes offer a ""class"" that you are required to take dealing with ""how to improve your ratings"" and they'll allow you to stay on the system.Needless to say, I'm thankful that after a couple thousand rides I'm still at 4.93, but without a doubt, it takes effort!!!"
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",SmittenKitten,9547,9538,"No, Uber doesn’t official state that 4.6 is a cutoff. It’s a number many drivers observed so that’s what’s been communicated around.The cutoff is different from market to market. I heard the average driver ratings are higher in newer markets and smaller cities for example. (So higher cutoff?)"
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",TonyAlmeida,9548,9547,"No, I bet the threshold is lower in new markets.Uber won’t be quick to deactivate drivers in new and smaller cities where they are trying to establish presence and still ramping up on drivers.They probably try to deactivate drivers in cities where the driver is saturated in fact.

"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",UberBlackenedZ,9549,9144,"I’ve had pickups longer than 20 minutes but they have all been in the suburbs and I believe they were also scheduled rides to the airport. (Not sure if the latter has anything to do with it.) I am sure it happens in areas where drivers are more dispersed. I don’t know for sure but some areas like Cape Cod, Outer Banks, and Jersey Shore I always think they must drive long ways to pick up passengers because they’re big areas.For trips over 20 minutes (or anything over 8 miles or something) you get long pickup fees. They never seem to be what they make it out to be though.We are supposed to get paid mile and distance, but they must only apply to the part that’s considered as “long” and not the entire pickup trip. Some I’ve collected were like $3 and $8.  I’ve heard from others they received amount in the pennies."
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",momof4,9551,9549,I get long pick ups in the city also usually 12 or 20 min. Lately I've got a few for 9 min. Yes they are usually under 2.00. The higher ones I got were only because of surge. It seems like the fee only kicks in when you actually take 12 or 20 min to get there. When first started I would get there before allotted time and wouldnt get a dime. Other times I notice them is when i am in surged area. Those drivers probably left where they to try to catch surge and then those areas were short. Before new app i would be in surged area but would get long pickups put of surge.

Too long, too short, somewhere they dont want to go they will cancel. They cant do this on too many trips as cancellations can get you into some trouble. We do have some leeway though.

Done picking up at grocery stores.,RobinH74,Donepickingu,0,"I am done picking up at grocery stores. I get it that people who don't have cars have to go get food but it just does not work for us drivers.I just had this couple who had bags after bags of groceries - like 30, probably because they can't make it to the store that often. I was horrified as I pulled up of two shopping carts full of stuff, including three cases of beers and liquor. Then they had the gull to tell me they have conditions and that I need to help them. She was morbidly obese and he was on a walker which I had to also fold and put into the front seat. Well, I too have back problems from an accident with a semi a few years ago, and this is not what i signed up for.When we got to their house it was a trailer house - and they once asked me to carry the groceries to their porch. then they proceeded to move very slowly obviously accentuating their disabilities and making sure i knew that they were in no condition to carry them. To an uber driver time is money, so I start helping, just thinking i need to get these people out of the car but what really ticked me off is that this is what they expect out of drivers, any drivers, i think.  i wasted 20 minutes on this couple carrying stuff they should be able to carry. no i am not your chauffer and a butler.and of course they didn't tip. not at all.

How do I know if the Uber driver is who he says he is?,"ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLC",ippei1202Ube,HowdoIknowif,"Driver identity is important. Check his/her name, photo and vehicle info. Also ""Real-Time ID Check"" for driver. Finally, check out Uber Beacon.One of the safety measures of Uber is that you know who will be driving you.  The driver cannot drive anonymously, and his information as well as the vehicle's is shared with you.  (In fact, Uber driver cannot use an alias either.  The first name MUST be his or her real name on the driver's license.Upon calling a rideWhen you request a ride, the Uber app sends your request to nearby drivers. After you've been assigned a driver, Uber sends you information about the vehicle and driver headed to your pickup location.Verify the vehicle/driver.Tap the bar that includes the driver’s name, photo, and vehicle. This displays a photo of your driver along with the vehicle's make, model, and license plate number.As the car approaches, check the make and model, and then match the license plate.  Once you are in the vehicle, you can match the driver with his or her picture in the app.In most juristdictions, Uber and Lyft both require the driver to display the Uber or Lyft sticker on their front windshield.  You may want to check that too.Car info matches, but what about the driver?  Uber's ""Real-Time ID"" Feature:In order to prevent fraud where different people may be sharing and driving the same car (and hence Uber account), Uber has been employing a feature called ""Real-Time ID Check.""  This is a mechanism built into the Uber Driver app where drivers need to validate their identify by taking selfies of themselves. Then the facial-recognition feature will identify the driver and determine if he is who he say he is. They can be prompted at a beginning of a shift or asked during a shift. (For more informatino, click here:https://eng.uber.com/real-time-id-check/)Uber Beacon- ""Uber Beacon"" is the light that shines on driver's windshield.  As the assigned passenger, you can specify within your app the color of the light using this feature.  Limited to drivers who support them.  More information here:What are Uber Beacons?

NOTHING CHANGED except that you're wasting the drivers time and pushing him/her to frustration and ride cancellation.  If you're lucky and they do put up with your ridiculous antics, hopefully you won't have pissed them off enough for them to destroy your rider rating.If you're that paranoid, please just ride the bus."

Honest, it's not the money as much as the insult and sore feelings.On this last Sunday at about 11 pm I had a full car of pool passengers and finally got to the last stop. Now this woman hadn't been where she was supposed to be when I picked her up so I assumed she wouldn't live anywhere near the drop-off either. I'd usually take the passenger to their home anyway–which really makes me the chump but I feel better about myself. Well, there was no indication of her eventual destination so I stopped and it all began.""Why are you stopping here? This isn't my home!""""Because this is an ExpressPool and right here is where I'm supposed to drop you off.""It escalated from there. I even pulled the car around and began to head to her home but she wouldn't (or couldn't) tell me where to go. Then she started to shout at me and, I'll admit it, I flared up and said, ""Don't yell at me, ma'am. Not when I'm doing you a favor!""It got a bit worse from there and I told her to get out–she didn't–and then she told me to stop and she would walk. Then I stopped a bit too fast. I thought she'd close the back-door–she didn't–and then she threw something at the car. At first, I thought it was a rock or something damaging but when I opened the door, it turned out to be her plastic soda cup. So I got out and picked up her trash, walked around the car to close the rear door, and got back in.When I was leaning down to put her cup into the waterproof trash bag I strap to the front seat, she came up and said something to the effect of ""Do not mess with me"" and I noticed a two-inch electric spark about 8 inches from my nose.OK, so it was some sort of Stun Gun and not a Tazer but it sounds better.Oddly, I wasn't all that worried about it. All they do is hurt and, I don't carry any money. (My personal Uber mantra).She stomped off. I drove to a quiet spot and spend quite a while emailing Uber and downloading all the audio from my cashcam. I'm upgrading to one that will record video in both front and back seat but I've only got audio at the moment. Blew the Quest cash, of course.So the moral of this story? I'm not picking up any Pools until Uber gets rid of ExpressPool. It makes you act like the worst Uber driver in the world, the passengers feel treated badly, and it just ends with everyone pissed off.It doesn't help when some little college twerp makes you feel like a chump.My wife tells me that all the time, I don't need remindingRead less..."

"As a Driver, will you buy Uber or Lyft stock when it becomes available?",Wes,"AsaDriver,wi",0,"It appears both Lyft (which has already initiated the paperwork to go Public) and now Uber is rushing to follow, will go public in 2019.  This means stock will be available to anyone that can afford to invest.Which begs the question - will you, as a driver that truly understands how Uber/Lyft operate, be willing (assuming you're financially capable) to invest in Uber or Lyft stock?  Do you feel it's a good long term investment, and if so, why?As a driver myself, I certainly appreciate that anyone driving Uber/Lyft full time as a primary source of income will most likely not have the financial wherewithal to invest in the company, so let's say hypothetically, if you could do so, would you, and if so, why do you feel it will be a good investment?"

The problem with Uber or Lyft that they have nothing except the app and a bunch of greedy people. Drivers who drive with Uber don't like how they are treated and because Uber and Lyft robber them. They charge riders up to 160% more money than they pay to the drivers! People drive with Uber only in a difficult situation when they need a cash. Nobody from them intend to drive with Uber if they will get another source of income. Because this is a hard not profitable job. All money what they get this is really a payment for depreciation of their cars. Other thing that this app what Uber and Lyft have created is a really simple app. On Kickstarter have already started a new peer to peer  Free Global Transport Sharing App witch will eliminate a middle man and kill Uber and Lyft instantly. So, if you don't want to loose your money, don't buy Uber or Lyft stock! Or sell it or take a short position if you already bought it."

Uber already has the market saturated so growth will be hard fought for them. Lyft's growth kinda depends on stealing market share from Uber, which will be very expensive.Both of these companies are spending money like drunken sailors and that is not going to stop anytime soon. It is a brutal battle out there and more competitors are going to be moving in on them. These are not lean companies.So my advice... buy some for fun if you want once the price settles a bit but don't go crazy, don't spend more than you can afford to lose, and don't expect to fund your retirement with it..."

Rideshare drivers would not fall into same category as cab drivers by any stretch in this chart. We need our own category and the percentage of tipping passengers would probably be no more that 30 (and I am being generous).If passengers being accustomed these days to not tip rideshare drivers and occasionaly order a cab, I bet their cheapness travels with them and even the cab drivers will now get less tips because of it.I do not think I will ever see a cultural shift with passengers enough to have rideshare drivers in a similar chart with tipping passengers in 60/70% range"

Do drivers agree that riders tip 90% of the time?,momof4,10559,10557,"I dont think tipping rideshare drivers is ever going to reach 50%:) Tipping % seems to have gone down from how many riders tip and how much they tip. Had many more tips and bigger tips when I first started then compared to this year. I drive bigger vehicle, navagation has improved (not that it was bad before), ratings pretty much the same as last year,  got a little more cautious with my driving but not to an extreme. Havent really changed anything. So not sure why tips are less frequent and definately less amt. then use to receive. Cheaper riders? Younger riders? Definately notice under 30 yrs old are awful tippers."
Tipping chart. Do drivers agree that riders tip 90% of the time?,AsStibelDude,10587,10559,"50% sounds right. Though, I've had candid talks with my passengers and they were surprised to be told not everyone tips.  So it isn't that people tip 50% of the time.  It's that 50% of the people never tip. They don't know or realize there's an expectation.This will eventually change, as this cannot be sustained as a societal norm. (where some pay and some don't)   An expectation or ""commonsense"" or ""rule"" will be established at some point, and EVERYONE will folow that. We just don't know where that norm will be set."
Tipping chart. Do drivers agree that riders tip 90% of the time?,SteffGart24,10583,10557,"I second this. This says taxi drivers.  For them, it was definitely a norm where the tipping was expected.  90% basically means ""everyone"", except that there are always bad apples.BTW, I don't believe bartenders get tipped 98% of the time. That just doesn't make sense."

Tipping chart. Do drivers agree that riders tip 90% of the time?,momof4,10875,10872,Yes agreed. I started the month Uber came out with tipping. Last year for the first 6 to 8 mths didnt do great but got more and decent tips then. Seems to have fizzled out over past 6 mths. Dont see has many tips as before. Havent changed anything. If anything drive an SUV now more room. You would think during holidays they would get better but no they dont.
Tipping chart. Do drivers agree that riders tip 90% of the time?,dreamcatcher,10842,Tippingchart,really 99.5% of people tip wait staff? I think that is too high. I was a waitress for many years and there are some a**holes out there
Tipping chart. Do drivers agree that riders tip 90% of the time?,SidA-1,10584,Tippingchart,"This is an excellent tip.""Tip more if you get off somewhere where they're unlikely to find a customer.""...but... this basically speaks to when the driver has to take on the expense (out of pocket) to continue working.  It can be applied to so many other situations when it's rideshares.Say- ""Tip more if your trip is shorter than 10 minutes or 2 miles...lazy bum.""- ""You make the driver wait more than a few minutes on the curb."""
Tipping chart. Do drivers agree that riders tip 90% of the time?,DimSumUng,10585,10584,"I like these suggestions as well.  I like it how it doesn't say commonsense stuff like:- ""Tip when they greet you nicely.""- ""Tip more when they get you to the destination.""- ""Tip when puts one light backpack in the trunk.""...because I am starting to feel drivers are entitled and expect tips for things that they should be doing already."
Tipping chart. Do drivers agree that riders tip 90% of the time?,MattC,10654,10585,"Drivers dont need to put things in their trunk for you. Yes its the right thing to do but it is a shared ride service. Anything a driver does beyond being nice and respectful, clean car is an added benefit to rider. There is another post on here where driver avoids a very bad accident. He was tipped 60.00. Although that was very generous yhe riders couldve done less and it still wouldve been appreciated i am sure by the driver. Drivers come in contact with many morons, drunks, careless drivers etc... Why not tip a driver even $2/3 for getting you safely to destination, being respectful, kind, clean car, etc... thats not asking much."

Do drivers agree that riders tip 90% of the time?,KellyVogel,10963,Tippingchart,"I have driven rideshare for 1 year and I have signs and snacks and chargers and water...all the amenities. I get tipped about 40-50% of rides. Not surprisingly, the people who they are going to leave a big tip never leave anything. Same as when I waited tables in college. A-holes. If i’m lucky, I total about 9-10% in tips. Which sucks because the nice clean car costs me minimum $3 per day, gas from 15-26$ per day plus the costs for snacks, water, emisis bags etc...People. Really. I hope all of the college kids who ate all my food and threw the trash all over my car and the people who didn’t get a vomit clean up fee because i came prepared realize that next time a ride sucks it’s Rideshare Karma."

Tipping chart. Do drivers agree that riders tip 90% of the time?,odjel,10606,Tippingchart,"Of course not but this does say ""cab driver"".

Tipping chart. Do drivers agree that riders tip 90% of the time?,Bigfrank,14282,Tippingchart,you cannot force people to tip because rideshare apps have more people that are tightwads and would rather cut their hands off before they tip. legally you can apply a 15% surcharge that goes directly to the driver . STAND IN UNITY
Tipping chart. Do drivers agree that riders tip 90% of the time?,momof4,14297,14282,Would be nice. Wouldnt cost Uber and Lyft a dime. Drivers would get an increase. See that as a win win. What is  common sense to most people doesnt always apply to everyone especially these big greedy companies. CEO's that make 46M per year dont care about the little people (drivers). Even though its not coming out of their pockets. Most people depend on using rideshare and will not stop for 15% surcharge. Those who do stop would be the terrible low rated cheap asses that dont belong in our cars anyway.

The thief or thieves appear to have a hack into the Uber computer or just knows a heck of a lot about it.

I thought it might be one of the calls that Uber transfers through a mangler so no one can learn the other's real number so I answered.A man on a terrible phone connection (which also made me think it was legitimate) said he was from the ""Uber Main Office in San Francisco"" and they wanted to give me a $400 gift certificate for passing 1,000 5-star rides and having a high star rating.

Finally, it was my password so that they could ""attach the $400 debit card to my account."" Right then another, legitimate rider beeped in and it got a bit confusing. I gave the codt to him thinking I could change if quickly. I said I was uncomfortable and he said ""I'm from the Uber Main Office in San Francisco."" about three times.I have NO EXCUSE.What looked like more Uber codes and fill-in the box answers. He wished me well and hung up.What I noticed first was that I couldn't make calls from my car. The Uber system said it didn't recognize my number and then spun me back to the same two ""Enter your phone number"" question and answer sequences over and over. I WISH Uber didn't have such a thing against real people answering their phones!When I got home, I realized I'd been screwed good. Over the next three days, I realized he'd changed my phone number, changed all my bank codes, added an ATM debit card to my account, changed the system so I couldn't change things or get rid of the new debit card.I changed my email and password first but I think he'd also done something with my password system because I couldn't get it to stabilize. it would work and then freeze up. That could just be the usual conflict between Uber and my Dashlane password system.Of course all communication with Uber is by email and none of those Greenlight places were open. The first Email said that other drivers had been seeing the same problems and suggested I change my passwordI didn't know this at the time but I was getting emails from Uber telling me that there was strange activity on my account. I don't have emails come through when I'm working to minimize confusion.I emailed, called, and screamed to get that ATM card off my system but, since I didn't have another to replace it, I couldn't. This week was a looooong wait until the payoff showed up in my bank account.So, just a word to the wiser that a grifter with a LOT of history with Uber and the gift of gab is out there. One .of the emails said the initial weird stuff came from the New York City area. I'm ashamed he got me even though I (don't think) I've lost any money. I sure lost a lot of wasted time. On the positive side, Uber had decided the weekend was a cheapie and we're only offering $105 for 65 rides so I wasn't going to work that hard anyway.Read less..."

The rider lets the Uber app grab his or her location, and then the rquest is sent out.The problem is that that exact location is being geocoded to an address that driver's GPS can resolve and navigate to.Due to the fact that the driver needs to be given an address for the sake of the navigation, at some point, the passenger location needs to be translated to an address.  That's probably where the rub occurs.I haven't driven recently in a long time, so I cannot rememeber what pin location the drivers see.  Is it address or the user's original location?  I am thinking it was the prior."

Uber Drivers: How Far Will You Drive To Pick-Up A Fare Not Knowing Their Destination?,Goodideasll,UberDrivers:,0,"Uber Drivers: How Far Will You Drive To Pick-Up A Fare Without Knowing Their Destination?  Okay, here’s what happened today to me - I signed on to my Driver Uber App and a Premium Destination popped up. I accepted the pick-up and app informed me that the customer was 27 minutes and 13 miles away. I drove there , it took about 22 minutes. I picked up client at her house , pressed my App for the drop-off Destination , and saw that drop-off was 1 mile away. I chatted with the lady, dropped her off and headed back to my hometown of Plattsburgh, NY. Total time of trip, back and forth, 45 to 50 minutes and 29 miles , and I earned $8 dollars.  So, after thinking about it, I have decided to ‘decline’ all trips that are more than 10 miles away from me and do not say that it is gonna be a ‘long trip’ ( one of those trips that say it’s a long way, I forget the exact wording). So, my question is, to you experienced drivers - what is your threshold for accepting trips and how far will you drive w/o knowing their destinations? Thank You in advance, Goodideasll - Lou !😊"

If Uber assigns a ride that makes someone drive twenty minnutes to complete the task on Uber's behalf, then it is only right that they cover that cost of getting there.I think Uber should reduce it's take from the drivers money to a strict 15% of gross and look for alternative revenue streams to make up the difference.

"As an Uber/Lyft driver, how has driving affected your family/relationship life?",bob,7705,7680,I have always thought that taxis and rideshares should charge a extra per person fee. You are right that the wear and tear on the car with 400 extra pounds is real. Some taxis (in some cities) do have extra person charges like $1 per person after the first rider but they are usually very small fees.

Should I give low ratings to Uber drivers who solicit tips?,momof4,8833,ShouldIgivel,"I see this is an old question but going to throw my .2  into it anyway. I agree with CaspPer. If its a subtle sign, tip box, etc. Then I do not see the harm and definately dont see why you would give driver low rating.  Zaferian I agree with you on that one, not buying that story. Kstark77 no one is asking for ""the community to subsidize workers"". In the taxi industry it's well known you tip the driver. I get technically Uber isnt a taxi but same concept. You are getting a discounted ride compared to a taxi, you are getting to and from somewhere safely, if you are happy with the service dont get why cant you tip the driver a few dollars? I know many drivers that go out of their way for riders or provide amenties in their vehicle for riders. Not to mention the crap we put up with from certain riders. A $2/$3 tip is not ""sticking it"" to the rider. Just seems like you are too cheap to give a small tip for a job well done. You probably dont tip in restaurants either.  Waitresses only get pd $3 so why should ""community have to subsidize them""? Happy everyone doesn't think like you."

Should I give low ratings to Uber drivers who solicit tips?,LG-PA,10071,10063,"Good stuff. You definitely get it!I wish more riders were as informed as you;)I am a driver, I never ask for tips, not complain. Like you I would feel less inclined to tip a driver who openly asks for it. I will automatically tip all waiters, drivers, passenger luggage handlers, etc. by default.I can see drivers are doing it out of desperation since neither rideshare company actually educated the rider base, not on tipping, nor on car seats for children. Sonsrivers left fending for themselves trying to educate the general public. I however do think that openly asking for tips via jar, or verbal requests is not good for driver image.I have a simple small one sentence sign on back of center console where vents are for rear passenger “Please rate your ride/trip in app ;)”No mention of tipping, but by doing so I am hoping passengers will be more inclined to actually rate the trip and we all know what screen comes up next, yup the tipping one, so if the passenger already went through trouble of rating me, hopefully 5 stars, good chance they will also add me a few bucks if they feel I earned it while they are at it."

That’s about it. Expecting someone to have a bubbly demeanor and a perfect car after a 10-12 hour shift is unrealistic and unreasonable.I still believe they should replace/supplement this 5 star business with a simple one question survey.

Keeping the two (driver/rider) separated might be the best thing for everyone. Some people just don't get along for whatever reason. If a driver gets enough WOULD NOTs, through lack of business they will eventually go broke and die off from attrition. Let the five star system be informational and the WOULD/WOULD NOT survey kill off the bad eggs.You have too many riders trying to scam free rides, taking out their daily angst on a driver, or they themselves are intoxicated or high and looking for a beef wherever they can find it. Uber and Lyft put far more weight on this ratings business than the riders probably realize. There are people who would NEVER give someone a five out of five about anything, because they believe nothing is perfect and it doesn’t take too many four stars to put a driver in range of danger of being removed from the platform.

Green drivers go to great lengths with snacks and amenities etc. to pursue those 5 star ratings at a cost they do not realize. A water and a pack of crackers/nuts will eat up half your profit for a less than 5 mile ride.This rating system is best described as a non-zero-sum game.Cooperation is usually analysed in game theory by means of a theory called the ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" (Axelrod, 1984). The two players in the game can choose between two moves, either ""cooperate"" or ""defect"". The idea is that each player gains when both cooperate, but if only one of them cooperates, the other one, who defects, will gain more. If both defect, both lose (or gain very little) but not as much as the ""cheated"" cooperator whose cooperation is not returned. If rider and driver collaborate and give each other 5 stars, everyone is happy. If the rider ""defects"" and gives the driver a 1 star rating to get back at them or to try and scam a free ride they are cheating the driver and the purpose of the system. If the driver in turn gives the rider a 1 star rating to get back at behavioral issues, they are also cheating the system of clientele. If both rate each other 1 star. Nobody wins.

Uber Destination Mode Paying 30% Less,PattyMelt,UberDestinat,0,Uber apparently has been taken over by Bernie Sanders. They don’t want us using destination mode anymore so instead of simply disabling it they are going to pay us 30% less while using it and re-distribute that money to the drivers that do not use the destination mode.How do drivers feel about this?  There is a way to submit feedback on the announcement they released in Chicago today. If you are against this idea you should probably go say something.I feel like customers are going to get in my car now hoping to go to their far away destination and I’m going to have to say I’m sorry I have to deadhead all the way back or wait a long time to do it at 30% less pay which is charity work.

I am sure Lyft will follow Uber in this idiotic decision, but angering drivers prior to IPO for Uber was probably not the smartest thing.If I was Uber I would retract this after a week and to save Face would say that it did not work.

Uber Destination Mode Paying 30% Less,KyleBenhart,12887,12606,Cost is the same for riders. Drivers get money taken out.

This type of driver works a full-time job or perhaps takes care of a relative that lives far away and they supplement their commute with destination mode but aside from that they pretty much never touch the thing except for big moneymaking holidays.In our Chicago market it is absolutely mind blowing how thousands of drivers literally just appear out of nowhere during surcharges or major holidays. They literally just magically spawn in the thousands.  I think a lot of these types are sitting watching Netflix keeping an eye on the surcharges in or around where they live. Remember a lot of these drivers literally don’t even need the money they just like getting out of the house. It sounds crazy but it’s true.If the company wants to do something proactive about destination mode because of the type C drivers then hot Diggity dog make it so that your destination mode works this week but then Sunday night Monday morning when the week ends if you haven’t done at least XX amount of rides it is disabled entirely for the following week.  Should  they complete XX amount of rides during that blackout week it immediately unlocks they don’t even have to wait for the following week to start.Read less..."

This way the Uber platform thinks there are more drivers out there available to pick up passengers, but when the drivers do not actually pick up the passengers (on destination filter) creates longer wait times for passengers and they will start switching to Lyft. If more drivers will do that more passengers will switch and fantasy of decreasing Uber pax wait time will evaporate at Uber as it will have the opposite effect:)"
Uber Destination Mode Paying 30% Less,KyleBenhart,12253,12202,Not a bad idea... However i have found at some point they just stop sending you request if u refuse to accept.I do admire your Bold initiative though.On thing i have done to spite the system is accept Pool rides and refuse to pick then up (specifically out in the suburbs where i am from at 1 in the morning) no way i accept a reduced fair that i only end up making back if we find somebody going in your direction this late. Most od the time i find these pook rides to be short jerkers who can't afford the extra dollar. But cost me 1.I refuse to cancel and make them get a cancel fee. Its petty but knowing i wasted their money the way they waste mine with their short cheap fair rides makes me happy. Btw. I have found that Pools never tip. How can they when they cant afford the extra dollar for their own full car.
Uber Destination Mode Paying 30% Less,LG-PA,12256,12253,"Not only do pools never tip, they are the cause of majority of low ratings we get. I do not do pools or shared rides.

I have heard rumors that what they were doing was not helping their case trying to fight off litigation requiring they classify their drivers as employees snd not independent contractors.  Taking people’s money away and giving it to me and you is something you would do to your employees (Which you cannot legally do either but at least it makes more sense in theory) not your contractors.It’s like if you hired a plumber and he did a bad job and you were like you know what I’m gonna pay my dentist part of what I owe you.All I’m gonna say is I hope whoever came up with this at Uber lost their job and anyone who encouraged them along the way should definitely be written up.
Uber Destination Mode Paying 30% Less,PattyMelt,12114,UberDestinat,I don’t see how something that can only be used twice a day is being overused. Sometimes Uber sends me 80 miles away from my home usually not one long trip but multiple trips.  It is a pretty far stretch to the far north suburbs of Chicago. I already eat those dead miles typically coming back but at least with destination mode there is a small chance I could get a ride.

That would make it a lot more palatable for all.In the musical you can make it so that Uber never designed and hard coded the destinations mode feature at all. A bunch of hacker drivers went all renegade and they hacked Uber. Instead of trying to steal customer credit card information or what have you they uploaded a worm called destination mode.This worm allows drivers twice a day to aim towards or away from a metropolis. Somebody from the group of hacker drivers has second thoughts about it and attempts to reach out to the media.  But before that driver could expose the scandal he winds up dead on a toilet just like Elvis. Frankly it’s a little surprising Kennedy didn’t also die on a toilet. It’s like whoever covers up these crimes tries a little bit too hard.I’m telling you right here and right now if Renee Zellweger was in this musical I’m just going to say you know what take 90% of destination mode it’s worth it man, totally worth it.Read less..."
Uber Destination Mode Paying 30% Less,momof4,12481,12478,😄I dont see how its fair they we benefit off other drivers loss. Nothing Uber does is fair so dont know why I am surprised. Maybe Bernie pitched the idea to Uber. You could save your destination pay for 6 months to buy your ticket:) Try not to spend thst money all at once:)

I would 100% understand if maybe u used it more than 1 or 2 times then to do this. But most of us are using it to get home.I hate to admit it. But i think this will drive off drivers.

Uber to require a 6-hour break for every 12 hours of driving in the U.S.,TonyAlmeida,Ubertorequir,0,"This is good, right?  Combatting sleepy and overworked drivers.""Uber has added a feature that will force a six-hour offline break whenever a driver on its platform reaches 12 hours of driving time. The feature is similar to one that Uber has in place in a few markets already around the U.S., which differs depending on local regulations, but this will apply across the U.S., and fully block use of the driver app for accepting trips during the six-hour period when it becomes active.""""Uber’s decision to roll this out was made as a response to the problem of drowsy driving and driver fatigue, both of which are issues that continue to affect people on the road, even if driving while using mobile devices and intoxicated driving get more press and scrutiny.""and it looks like they put some thoughts into this:""The Uber feature implementation will trigger when a driver has driven 12 hours without taking a continual, six-hour break at any point between. Drivers will have full visibility into how much driving they’ve done according to Uber, which measures based on a number of factors, and will count things like when you’re stopped at a stoplight (your brain is still engaged in the driving activity, even if you’re temporarily stopped), but won’t count time spent waiting in an airport parking lot to be called for a pickup, for instance, since many drivers use these as napping and rest opportunities."""

You cannot pick up anywhere, however.Uber drivers can only operate and pick up passengers in areas for which they have been assigned and approved.  This has to do with how each local areas have different laws and regulations. You are applying to drive in a certain territory, and you are approved for that specific territory.To clarify, it is important to point out that you can pick up in your own area only, butyou can drop off outside of your territoryin any location.  This means that you can leave your territory with a passenger but you cannot pick up on the way home.Uber can make exceptions to this rule and approve you to drive in multiple states if given a proper justification.  They also approve temporary relocations, where, say, you decide to move to another state for the summer, they can grant you to operate in that area for a few months.Lyft used to have a much relaxed policy, where you could drive in multiple cities and states, and they did not have the concept of having any territories.  However, as the local laws and regulations tightened, they have implemented these restrictions.UPDATE: It is important to also remember that depending on your local area, Uber often extends your coverage area (where you can pickup and receive requests from) to the surrounding territories/states.  For example, if you are approved to drive in New Jersey, you will receive requests in states like PA, NY, DE, CT, and Western MA.  (not NYC, due to TLC requirements.))ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Jun 28, 2018"

How is it on pool Uber makes more than Driver? Just had a trip 2 pools my t ...,SyedAli,7870,7445,Right.  The easiest way to remember is that you still get paid for the duration and distance you drive.  It has nothing to do with how many riders you are driving around.
How is it on pool Uber makes more than Driver? Just had a trip 2 pools my t ...,amcbeth,9553,7870,"It has a LOT to do for the number of riders. If you have four separate pool riders in Philadelphia, then $8 plus their fees are subtracted from the riders payments, BEFORE Uber starts ratioing what the driver gets. This is the reason that Uber makes MORE than a driver  on some pools.Also each rider is counted as a trip.This is not speculation, you can see all of the above in when you login to Ubers partners app."

How is it on pool Uber makes more than Driver? Just had a trip 2 pools my t ...,momof4,7355,7354,That happened a few months ago to me. I was getting all Uber X then started getting a lot of pools so I did stop accepting them. Tonight was slow so I took the pool ride. I just went back over other  pool fares this is the first one Uber has ever taken more money than I earned. I got a 3.00 tip from the one rider so that helped somewhat. I sent Uber a message of course the computer will generate it's standard scripted answer explaining how pool fares work. I will never take another pool again. Thank you for your answer.
How is it on pool Uber makes more than Driver? Just had a trip 2 pools my t ...,amcbeth,9217,Howisitonpoo,This occurs if there are two or more riders in the pool and the rides are SHORT.Assuming  the ride was an UberX and it was short. In Philadelphia the driver earns $3.75.Now take the exact same ride with three pool riders. Uber charges each one of them a $2 booking fee. These booking fees (plus any other fees) are subtracted from what the riders pay before allocating the pay to the driver.The result is the driver may earn something close to $3.75 but Uber gets at little more than $6.The good thing is SOMETIMES Uber subsidizes the rides and the driver makes out.
How is it on pool Uber makes more than Driver? Just had a trip 2 pools my t ...,JWileySmith,7366,Howisitonpoo,"Ooooh, it's happening.  We all suspected this to happen when it was introduced, and last year's 180 days initiative is now bringing this to light.With UberPool, Uber makes out like a bandit, because there are multiple rider parties taking and sharing the ride.   Uber collects 2x the amount of fare less a small discount, and the drivers are still paid for duration and distance, i.e. the same plus a bit more because they are driving longer to make up multiple stops.Let's say from an airport to the train station, it's$10 for UberX riders and the driver gets paid $5.Then they came up with UberPool and started offering this same trip for $9.00, a dollar discount for a minor inconvenience.  Now, let's imagine the driver picks up two groups of riders.  They both pay $9 x 2 for a total of $18.  The driver still gets $5 plus a tiny bit for a longer trip to pick up the two passengers, so, let's say $6.Gasp!  Uber ade $12 and the driver made $6.Pretty much all of the efficiency created and the profit associated with it went straight to Uber's pocket."

How is it on pool Uber makes more than Driver? Just had a trip 2 pools my t ...,momof4,8215,Howisitonpoo,I originally posted this because of 2 trips that Uber made more than I did. Never had that happen. I was driving Saturday night and declined a few pool trips. As I was driving driving a passenger a request came up. Since i had a passenger didnt want to take my eyes off the road to see the request and with new app the print is smaller so I ended up accepting a pool. Of course it was a ride into Center City which is about 25 min 15.55 miles. Rider pd. $17.15  I got 18.46 Uber took -1.68 other .37. There was no surge in pick up or drop off and no tip. A fare like this pool is usually 12.00 for pool to this area. Then I took another pool trip 26 min. 10.5 miles plus a cancellation fee for 2nd rider I received 17.58. This would normally be a 8.00 to 10.00 ride for pool. On this trip rider payment 13.53 riders paid 13.43. There was an adjustment on Uber -7.60 Uber received -4.15. WTH? I am totally confused. If I figure out how to upload a screenshot I will post. ANY THOUGHTS? Afraid Uber will take back money at later date once they figure out their screw up because this cant be right.
How is it on pool Uber makes more than Driver? Just had a trip 2 pools my t ...,amcbeth,7945,Howisitonpoo,"The reason this happens in Philadelphia, is all riders are charged a $2 booking charge plus other fees. Lets say you pick up three riders at three different stops (a pool). Those riders all get out within 15 minutes.Uber will add three booking fees ($6) and any other fees they might charge the riders. All fees are added up and subtracted from what the riders paid. Now a 15 minute trip with only one rider doesn't pay much.A 15 minute trip with three riders you have to contend with at least $6 being subtracted from the rider payments. Yes Uber will definitely make more than you.If you try and figure the fees that Uber charges, you'll go nuts.In another post I took two months of payouts and used a spreadsheet to determine whether I should drive in South Jersey or Philadelphia. It wasn't close. Uber takes at minimum of 49% in South Jersey.In Philadephia, because I take a lot of pool rides, and Uber subsidizes most of them, I find that the percentage of what I get from the rider payments is much greater than in South Jersey."

Just had a trip 2 pools my t ...,petergunnarwilliams,13965,Howisitonpoo,"I used Uber Pool for the first time this week, and I was shocked that there was no financial benefit for the driver - only for Uber?  The ride was substantially cheaper for me - like half price, and there were 3 x 1 passengers in the car.   So the money coming in was, I guess, roughly 50% greater than if there'd been a single person in the vehicle.   But the driver said he got paid the same in any event?I love the idea of pooling - it's the future, so environmentally friendly, reduces congestion, saves fuel, cheaper for the consumers.   But it sucks that there's no incentive for the drivers.  Plus, if it really took off, it's reducing the number of pickups available for the drivers.  Ie before you had 3 rides going to the airport, and now only 1 driver might get that and 2 cars are not getting a fare.    So from the drivers point of view, it seems like all negatives.I would hope that if Uber are making 50% more (or whatever) on these rides, they could at least share some of that with the driver, to make up for the downsides?"

In the Battle of Rideshare Versus Taxi the Driver Always Loses,Samarov,IntheBattleo,0,"A lot has been written about ride-share services like Uber threatening the livelihood of cab drivers. In most of these articles Uber, Lyft, et al are pitted against local taxi companies like Yellow and Carriage. What is rarely made clear is that none of these companies—ride-share or traditional taxi—actually employ any drivers. So while they fight it out in the courts about regulations and who can and cannot get what part of the transportation market, the people doing the actual driving aren’t being represented by either side.In 1993—when I became a cab driver—calling a taxi was a simple business. You picked up your home or office telephone, dialed your favorite cab company, and waited outside for your ride to arrive. A cabbie had two choices for picking up fares: troll the streets for passengers or “play the radio,” which meant turning on the two-way and submitting to the whims of his company’s dispatcher. Picture Danny DeVito in “Taxi” for an idea of the types we had to deal with.A year or two into the job I got a bag phone for the cab. For those who don’t remember, this was an early version of a cell-phone which had to be plugged into the cigarette lighter in order to function.

This complicated rig enabled the cab driver to receive calls directly from customers, thereby giving him a way to increase his income.Dispatched calls changed in the 2000s with the advent of Gandalf terminals in taxis. Now, instead of a squawking voice giving you a constant low-grade headache throughout each shift, a screen listed available fares and it was just a matter of hitting the right buttons quicker than the other drivers to get the address of your next fare. Cell-phones evolved as well, so your regulars could summon you by voice or text with minimal effort.A few years ago, apps like Taxi Magic began to appear. They worked with cab companies to allow customers easier access to cabs. Taxi Magic gathered together the phone numbers of all local cab companies in one spot so they were easier to find. Unfortunately they did nothing to improve the problems of traditional taxi dispatching. Riders were still at the mercy of telephone operators who would stop answering the lines at peak times and drivers who had no compelling reason to pick up calls if there was enough business available on the street. The best either company dispatchers or Taxi Magic could ever do was let drivers know what fares were available, then hope, or sometimes plead that the driver would take them. The reason no company could compel a driver to pick up a passenger is that cabbies no longer work for companies. They all drove for themselves.Back in 1993, when I started driving, there were a few old-timers who were still working on commission. This meant that the company would take a percentage of their shift earnings, offer them benefits like health care, and treat them as part of their company. If they had a bad night the company would make less, which would cushion the blow. Newbies like me didn’t have this option. We had to pay to lease and gas up the company’s vehicles whether we made a dime during our shifts or not. It was a fundamental shift. Taxi companies were now basically rent-a-car agencies.There were about 7,000 licensed taxis in Chicago in 2014. Those licenses—called medallions—traded for around $300,000 each. In 2018 the prices have plunged as low as $50,000. Many medallion owners pay companies like Yellow Cab to manage the upkeep of their vehicles, make sure they pass yearly city inspections, and find drivers to lease the vehicles to. The city is heavily involved in regulating the industry, from setting meter rates to licensing drivers, though it remains a private business rather than a public utility, at least where taxes are concerned. The gray area between public and private makes the taxi business different than most others. The cab driver is providing a public service yet he’s not an employee of either the city or any company. He’s bound by many restrictive regulations yet rarely benefits from any protections a union or corporation can provide.Cab drivers hit the street at the beginning of every shift already in the red because we either owe the company that day’s lease or, if we’re owner-operators, we’re paying off the mortgage on the medallion, the car payment, or both. We look for every way to get access to more fares. So when Uber came to town in 2012 it seemed like a great chance to make a little more money. I was one of the first cab drivers they recruited in Chicago.Uber is not a traditional taxi or limousine company. They don’t have a garage and they don’t own vehicles. They’re a tech company that developed a dispatching app. They contract limo, taxi and private-vehicle drivers and handle payment, routing and other services through iPhones they distribute to participants. In Chicago they use current taxi rates and add twenty percent to cover their fees as well as tips for drivers. They charge flat fees for limo rides, which are generally a little more affordable than established limo companies. But with both taxis and limos they piggyback on existing pay structures and regulations to offer drivers an alternate way to pick up customers. They don’t have to worry about insurance or any of the other bureaucratic headaches that old companies have to deal with. All they concern themselves with is their iPhone app which connects drivers and riders.The app is a two-way GPS which lets both driver and rider track each other’s location and make contact if plans change. Cab companies currently have nothing approaching this kind of one-to-one connectivity. There is also a rating function which allows both sides to rate the ride. It’s like Yelp except if the restaurant could rate its customers as well. It gives everyone concerned at least a bit of a clue what they’re in for. One of the hardest things about driving a cab is guessing how a person getting into the car with you will behave themselves. This system takes a bit of that guesswork out of the equation. You can see their history with the click of a button. I only used Uber for a few months before quitting the business in the summer of 2012 but came away impressed.In the last couple years there has been a lot of litigation about how ride-share will fit into the city’s public-transportation ecosystem. Services like Uber, which use private cars rather than licensed taxis and limos, add another wrinkle to the puzzle. This is an age when full-time single-source employment seems to becoming but a fond memory. People are scrambling to cobble a living together any way they can. It’s a world of Airbnb and Etsy rather than Hilton and Sears, so it’s no surprise that people would try to earn some side cash using cars they already own. I’m not sure how it will all shake out but I’m convinced the cab companies are fighting a losing battle.The reason rideshare have overtaken the public vehicle business is that the taxi companies have failed to serve either their customers or their drivers well. By no longer offering commissions or benefits to drivers they have created an adversarial relationship where each side tries to get over on the other rather than working together. By failing to recognize advances in technology, they have mired themselves in an antiquated dispatching system that no one involved has much confidence in. In my last couple years behind the wheel, most of my business came from either street hails or by direct text from repeat customers and their friends. No one these days wants to sit on the phone waiting for an operator to pick up on the other end.Don’t take this to mean that ride-share is a cure-all. Uber has made blunders like peak-pricing, which put me in mind of price-gouging gas stations during the seventies fuel crisis. They’ll also undoubtedly need to require private-car drivers to carry commercial insurance. Almost half the cost of my cab lease was to cover insurance of various kinds. Otherwise drivers will spend more time in court than on the road. These new businesses will have their growing pains, but the city would be wise not to regulate them to death. If Chicago were to shut Uber et al down, ride-share would simply go underground. The industry has to acknowledge the way their customers live now. Whatever form of dispatch wins out, it would behoove the middlemen who run transportation companies to value the people who make their success possible. Treat the drivers, who make Uber, taxi, and every other form of public conveyance possible, like valued customers rather than chattel is key. There will always be a place for public vehicles in a city like Chicago. If Yellow Cab and its ilk wants to be part of that market, it would do well to realize that it’s 2018 rather than 1974.Read less..."

Now don't think that Lyft is not doing this as well they're just not doing it as bad as Uber is doing it. But at the same time drivers don't like working for Lyft because Lyft does not charge a long pickup fee and they're always sending drivers 25 to 35 minutes away for a ride. And if the driver gets there and that ride happened to be a $3 ride that driver loses money. So drivers when it comes to Lyft are not accepting rides over the 10-minute threshold Uber has in place as a long pickup fee. I need some drivers logo 14 minutes but they won't go 15 minutes away. Drivers also don't like working for Lyft because we can't say we want to drive XL only and only get XL request. I mean if you have a larger vehicle and that's all you want to do then I think you should be allowed to only do that. But the way the system is set up you got to keep refusing the regular rides if you don't want them. And that's not right fortunately Uber will allow people to do excel only so in the evening time and on weekends and during events when it's really profitable it's going to be hard to get a Lyft request because drivers have liftoff because they're working for Uber doing XL only. But there are several things that actually need to be done with both companies. White one a livable wage for drivers during the winter time drivers have to drive hundreds of miles away and sleep in their car and take showers at Planet Fitness just to make a living because their Market is a tourist market for the summer and nobody comes here during the winter. And those themed markets that drivers are going to pet people that are actually coming to our market and sleeping in their cars and taking showers at Planet Fitness to make money during the summer because their town is a college town and the kids are gone for the summer. So yes the number one thing is a livable wage across the board I mean there has to be a standard sitting place that no matter what state you were in this is what you're going to get. That's like the drivers over in California they got those rate so low that I would not personally drive her neither company I mean the fuel is $4 a gallon how can you survive only making $0.60 a mile as a driver. If drivers were compensated fairly we would actually be able to pay federal income tax. But as it stands right now the rates are so low that everything is written off due to our mileage. all drivers are doing is trading the equity of their vehicle for money right now. when that vehicle breaks down if that driver was not smart enough to save their money that driver is out of work with no way to fix their vehicle. And when you got to think about feeding little Sammy and Josephine and your wife sitting at home or maybe there's a couple more kids in there how the hell are you going to save money for a rainy day to fix your car. You're just SOL and out of work looking for a job hoping to come up with the money to fix your car so you can start back doing this part-time and keep that job because that job saved you. And if you get a driver that has a brand new vehicle just know this they're not going to be working too long because 70,000 miles on a vehicle per year means that they will still be paying for that vehicle after it's dead. The best thing a driver can do is buy used vehicle that they're able to pay cash for and then go out and make their money. And if they get a chance go ahead and purchase a second vehicle to have sitting for backup just in case that vehicle breaks down. Yes I know I got off topic a little bit but that's the life of a driver. And most of us drivers we don't put anything past Uber. They will steal our tips they will charge the customer a higher upfront price just because they tipped their driver. And yes we have seen that happen a driver made this going from point A to point B and got a $10 tip the driver got that same customer going back 2.8 Uber charge that customer the same thing that they charge the first time including what the passenger paid as a tip without their passenger actually tipping the second time. It is actually best for you to tip your drivers in cash because Uber has their algorithm setup to where they see that a customer tipped which means and never mind that the customer is willing to pay more so therefore they charge them more. I had a woman one time that I watched give me a $20 tip and I only got $10. I had another guy then I watched give me a $5 tip and I did not even get a tip Uber will steal from their drivers and they will steal from the passengers. there is no shame in their game. And they are protected up front pricing and all these different amendments to the policy that they make drivers agree to just to go back online. If a customer makes a false complaint against a driver that driver gets deactivated with no way to provide for their family for at least Forty-Eight Hours the first time. And yes that has happened to me but you know what the next time it happens I'm going to take a hair sample test and go to the courthouse to press charges against the person who made the complaint sure I can sue that person for all my lost wages and defamation of character. Because I don't drink and I don't use drugs but I had a customer say I was impaired just to get a free ride because I would not allow them to bring an open container into my car and then changed the trip to an XL ride because they had five people.Read less..."

I spend more time to reach them and drive more miles then the actual ride. No long pick up fee for XL in my market in Uber. At this point in time Uber and Lyft need to clean up a few issues. Safety, transparency, ratings, honesty, and increase the rates. Fix all the BS and make the companies better and safer. Not holding my breath. Yes you are correct Uber does know everything about our driving habits:) Still on the fence about them hiking prices when your phone is about to die:) although it wouldnt be unheard of.

Are you familiar with the issue of how much Uber/Lyft take from the drivers pay?Are you sympathetic to the drivers or are you just happy for cheap rides?,fpressly,Areyoufamili,0,"They claimed to take 20% of gross at one point (Uber and Lyft). Then it went to 25%. However if you carefully read the trip charges of your trips you see that Uber/Lyft take certain monies before the 75-25 split. This is different fees and charges the riders pay, that the driver never sees. There have been many times where I have looked at the trip charges and the total the rider pays. Uber/Lyft sometimes end up with 50% of the money the rider pays. When you call Uber on it they don't have any real clear answer either (except love it or leave it).Do you think this is fair? Especially as costly as it is to maintain a vehicle to the standards they expect. With rare exceptions most Uber/Lyft drivers make $3-$4 an hour (after all expenses). Knowing this, would it encourage you to tip more. What do you expect from a driver to give him a 5 star rating and at least a 20% tip on fares $10 or less and 15% on more than ten dollar rides?

This was two months ago! Everytime I communicate withLyft Support, they tell me that they will clear this up expeditiously. Yet, here we are - TWO MONTHS LATER waiting for their ‘help’! I would hate to see their response if I was not being given expedited help! As an aside, I haven’t been so sad not to drive lately anyhow, with all the surrealness in the world (Thank You So Much President Trump! ), ( that’s said facetiously, BTW), but I asked Lyft Support how many of their drivers have driven more than 300 trips and never received a rating less than 5 stars, like me? (Yes, I know that’s good but also lucky since 90 percent of my trips are with Uber!) That being said, I like driving for Lyft because occasionally I get some good long trips with Lyft!  Anyhow, I have sarcastically asked Lyft for some money from them for de-activating me for no reason. I have also asked to talk or text with a supervisor at Lyft Support but I have learned that will seemingly never happen!

In my time working for both I have not been able to figure out which is more incompetent!☹️But where we are in Plattsburgh, NY, there is a demand for Lyft rides but since COVID-19, there are only 3 or 4 drivers who drive sporadically. Before COVID there were 30 or 40,(you figure it out!). So, basically there is very little coverage. Most people just give up trying for a Lyft and go straight to Uber, at least that’s what they tell me! I have been reactivated on Lyft, but frankly, because they pissed me off for months and months, just not caring at all. I doubt I will drive for them very often, if, at all! Have A Great Day Kris !

However, you are forgetting that not everyone has a choice.  There are requirements to being a Uber driver that not everyone has...which is to own your own personal vehicle.There is also an illusion that drivers make more money off of Uber (and other rideshares) but that isn't always the case. It entirely depends on how much work you get and you have to consider for all of your own expenses...like your car!With Uber, how much work you get is dependent on where you work and when you work. If you work for established taxi companies with a foothold in the market, you can expect a steady stream of dispatch...at least with some stability.So to summarize:- no, not every driver has a choice- the pay may not be better on Uber"

At its highest point of one million it was. over inflated  and done so illegally but certain people took a blind eye. Without covid the medallion should be no more then 375000 . A driver pre covid would have grossed a average of 75000 per year and would be able to pay off the medallion in ten years interest included. At that point he or she could keep driving or lease it to a broker in which a monthly check similar to a pension would be paid . Now ride share aka black taxi comes along and floods the streets with no cap amount and kills a medallion owned by the City of NY and again a blind eye has caused two black eyes.

What are some tips and tricks to earning more from ride share.,fpressly,Whataresomet,0,"There are so many factors it is hard to quantify. First you have to be in a market where Uber is well established. Then you have to not have too much competition in other carriers like Lyft or too many Uber drivers. Then your vehicle and the costs associated with it will determine really how much you make. Having an older, nice car, like a Nissan Maxima or Toyota that you have no payments on and are real road warriors is your best bet. Then you have to watch your market for a couple of months to see where the surge patterns are (every market has cycles and “hotspots”). Learning to work surges is your best money. Buy AAA or any roadside assistance insurance (sometimes available with purchase of new tires). It will help in a pinch, when there is no one else to help.Then you have to be willing to commit 8–10 hours a day until you fine tune the demand. Deciding time of day you will work is next (for me 7–11am and 3-darkpm). Not driving around aimlessly while you wait for rides will save fuel. I work out of the half dozen Starbucks in my city. Good wifi, coffee, people to talk to, good place to read a book. Hanging out at airports or trying to make airport runs your core business is NOT good. Just because someone is getting off of a plane doesn’t mean they are going somewhere that is good for you. Developing a rolodex of regulars will make for steady income. My best advice is to get the proper insurance (get a ride share rider from your insurance company). You can work a whole year and it will be wiped out with one accident that you are not properly insured. Thank you for your upvote."

Though the driver is frantically trying to end the trip in the app, so he can start getting new pings, the reception does not allow him to do so, so the driver tries to move away from the bad reception area while still trying to end the trip he keeps driving and trying until it finally allows ot end. this may appear that the driver is intentionally trying to get extra out of the trip, but it is not always the case."

I am beyond annoyed, frustrated, angry, and disgusted by these parents who just dint give a damn and by drivers who just dont give a damn (fare is more important). Yes it sucks to pull up and waste time and money but is it really worth it???? No, it shouldnt be our responsibility to care for other peoples children. However it is our responsibility to uphold the laws regarding child safety seats.Uber and Lyft need to make this a priority. Any driver caught driving children with no seats should be deactivated. Every rider requesting ride with children and no seat should be deactivated also. No excuse. Rider should be charged with 25.00 fee if driver shows up & their is a child no seat. Maybe that would prevent these irresponsible parents from putting their kids in danger. It should prevent drivers from taking these kids with no seat also.When you put your kid in a car with a stranger you do not know if they are high, drunk, tired, or just plain careless. Even if driver is very safe what about the other idiots on the road? Dont think it will not happen to your child. I am sure every parent with a permanently injured or dead child  thought the way you did. Your job is to protect your children at least until the age of 18. Do your job KEEP YOUR CHILD SAFE.Can someone please explain wth is wrong with these parents? Does driver realize when they get in accident U/L going to say ""its in rules not to drive kids with no car seat, therefore we are not responsible"". Do drivers realize there is something called vehicular mansalaughter (3 to 15 yrs in prison)? Endangering the welfare of a child? Lawsuits? Just knowing I killed a child (my fault or another drivers fault, they were in my car with no seat) how could you live with that for the rest of your life? As many as 90% of Child deaths and injuries can be prevented by putting child in proper safety seat. It is the #1 killer of children.UBER AND LYFT DRIVERS PLEASE STOP DRIVING CHILDREN IN YOUR CAR WITHOUT A PROPER SAFETY SEAT.That $10/$20 ride is so not worth the risk. Fines, jail time, lawyer fees, etc... Is it really worth it? Not to mention living with the memories of killing a child. They child is going to fly through your car window or windshield. Or be killed by an airbag.

Perfect example of this is when she reached out to Lyft they gave her a cancel fee but didnt make mom pay it. Lyft paid it. How is that helping the situation. Like she stated Lyft dont suffer consequences either way. Driver has to waste their time driving to pick up and declining ride or driver picks up Lyft collects their fee from ride. If driver decides to take the ride (which isnt the best decision) and gets in accident its their ass in trouble. Lyft wont back driver and insurance wont cover. Where does Lyft lose? Thats why they bury a short statement in their rules. Their out in case of accident. Do you really think either company cares about the driver or their passengers?

I've asked quora readers to post any stories they may know of a child being injured or killed because a parent is too cluless, lazy, careless, irresponsible, or all of the above. Although I hate hearing about tragic stories especislly regarding children I feel the need to educate and raise awareness about this issue. Its not just rideshare that makes this an issue its the lack of knowledge, education, or the stupidity, carelessness, or the attitude that ""it wont happen to my kid"" that injures or kills these infants, toddlers, children under 10.I am asking the drivers out there to make a difference, to save a life, and raise awareness. I am asking parents to stop requesting rides if there is not an appropriate safety seat provided by you or a driver. Please take a few minutes to post a story, share a story, text, FB, Twitter, etc  to raise awareness. You just may a save a life. Looking to do a good deed or pay it forward its easy you  save a life, save a fellow driver from heartache, financial ruin, jail time etc. Please raise awareness 1 post, share, tweet, whatever you choose to use asking drivers to cancel these rides and rides not to request them. If you really are bored ir in between rides feel free to visit quora and read my answer. Feel free to add to my comment here or on quora. The more people that share, like, upvote, post, the more people we can reach in hopes of saving 1, 2, hundreds, maybe thousands of children who have clueless, irresponsible, parents. Would greatly appreciate if we could do something about helping or saving these kids. Everyday now I am getting adults with kids and no seat. First one at an airport the other night 14 month old mom and dad had the correct appropriate child safety seat. Had a 7 yr old was on taller side seatbelt wouldnt of been 100% perfect but thankfully I have booster. Approximately an hour 20 min long ride $97.00 plus 20.00 tip although declined was offered food & drink ftom BK.) Had they not had seat i would be looking at 3.75 had i not had my 14.00 booster seat same outcome 3.75. I also scored a return ride towards my destination this almost never happens when I am in this area with destination filter.  $53.77 fare, my tolls paid on return trip, 12.00 tip. The ride with the kids was not pleasant for first 25 min as the baby screamed her adorable head off. Once we got on TP, lowered heat, pulled over to a Burger King to change disper and put some country music on (not my favorite but apparently hers) she went sound sleep. My point being my trip was easier, relaxing after 25 min because i had no worries of getting a ticket for no seat and no worries that the baby or 7yr old was flying through my windshield or out my side windows. Had responsible parents. Was treated well, trip nice, parents grateful for booster, and with good karma for being patient, pulling over for diaper change, assuring mom who was anxious over baby crying that I wasnt annoyed over it so she should relax. I got a good tip and a decent rider on a return trip with tolls pd and another decent tip. So with that being said wouldn't it be nice if we didnt have to decline these no car seat trips because they were not being requested. Answer I would be happier and so us my my bank account. Not that they would do it but Uber and Lyft should make a policy that the 1st time you request a car and have no seat driver will cancel ride with a 5.00 fee being charged to rider and driver reports it. Any ride requested after that will continue to incur fees going up 10.00 each time. I will be willing to bet this stops the problem altogether. Since this will not be an option unfortunately. Lets just take a stand ourselves and stop it. As always thanks for reading my lengthy posts. Thanks to those who upvote.Read less..."

I am not a driver but this law needs to be followed better (tougher consequences?!). I mean these children are not deciding to get in an unsafe vehicle, they have no control over the situation, it is not fair that these ""parents"" can put their kids in this danger so easily and many people do not even bat an eye. This has to be solved."
DRIVERS STOP DRIVING CHILDREN WITHOUT CAR SEATS. Car Seat Issue Yet Again! What is wrong with patents? Drivers? Uber & Lyft???,momof4,10861,10839,I agree:) Problem with Uber/Lyft. They dont care. If driver is dumb enough to do it U/L will not back driver if they get in an accident but U/L figure some idiots will do it so they get their cut of that ride. Win/Win for them.
DRIVERS STOP DRIVING CHILDREN WITHOUT CAR SEATS. Car Seat Issue Yet Again! What is wrong with patents? Drivers? Uber & Lyft???,Cornell63,16958,DRIVERSSTOPD,"I completely agree with everything you said. I have declined many trips because of this issue. It pisses me off that some parents are willing to put their children's lives at risk for their own selfish convenience. Foolish drivers who transport children without a car seat do not seem to understand that they are risking a lifetime of unbearable guilt and grief associated with the possibility of being responsible for serious injury or death of an unrestrained child. Also the legal ramifications could cause financial ruin and lengthy prison sentences. As you said..Its not worth a $10, $20 or any other amount fare to risk this. Very well said."

Uber & Lyft???,Wes,10883,DRIVERSSTOPD,"It would be SO EASY for Uber to flash a message when ordering a ride to say ""Riders must be 18 unless accompanied by a parent/guardian.  Chidren under X years must be accompanied by an appropriate child seat,  installed by you,  and used consistently throughout the ride""...  How hard would that be?"
DRIVERS STOP DRIVING CHILDREN WITHOUT CAR SEATS. Car Seat Issue Yet Again! What is wrong with patents? Drivers? Uber & Lyft???,momof4,10885,10883,"Thats my point. It wouldnt be difficult. They make a 1/2 sentence mention of it in community guidelines. They know some drivers will still pick these people up which makes them money. If driver gets in accident they will say ""its in rules not to pick these people up"". So U/L win either way. Its the driver who loses either way by driving and then not being able to take ride or driver gets in accident. Thats where the real trouble starts. Charge these people a $25 fee if they are under 18 or dont have seats and guarantee it will stop."

Uber, Lyft, dont drug test nor do they do the best background checks. How do you know the person that is driving you you isnt drunk, high, tired? Lets assume your driver isnt drunk, high, tired, they never caused an accident what about the people on the road around them? I sat here trying to think of what possible situation could anyone have that would warrant not bringing a car seat. I really cant think of any.  Is there anything in this world that you need to do that is more important than your child's safety? How do you go on with your life if your child dies or is injured? I was going to say how unfair you are putting the driver in that postion but not only should driver refuse but your not keeping your child safe so why would you care about driver? Sorry but just think its very wrong, careless, just awful that people dont care about their child."
Uber Eats is not a profitable business. Here's the math. ...and how Uber has the cake and eats it too. (Forbes),SmittenKitten,UberEatsisno,0,"I am glad someone is doing the math.  It's too bad it isn't the drivers. I assume this applies to UberEats' competeitors like GrubHub, Postmates, and DoorDash.The problem here is that the average profit margin for a restaurant is under 30%. Fast food such as McDonalds reported profit margins about 22% in 2017. Casual dining or family style restaurants have a profit margin between 5% to 10%. Lastly, full-service restaurants such as fine-dining have average profit margins of about 6.1%. (source)Based on the average profit margins above, every restaurant that engages Uber Eats will lose money on every order they take. The more orders coming from Uber Eats, the more money a restaurant would lose.On the other side of the phone, you will have to pay a “booking fee” for your delivery that is also being paid directly to Uber.

RIDERS: What are some of your reasons for not tipping a driver?,momof4,RIDERS:Whata,0,"As a rider there are various reasons for taking Uber/Lyft. Here are some of the reasons riders gave me. DUI, suspended license,  dont want to drink & drive, lease car dont want to put miles on, dont have a car, cheaper than parking, and dont want to risk accident in bad weather, public transportation stinks in my area, cheaper, cleaner, more convenient then a cab.  They are saving you money, no risk to your car during inclement weather, no risk for you getting in accident if drinking & driving & saving you from DUI or worse.  If driver is polite, respectful, car is clean, drives you safely from point A to point B, maybe offers chargers & other amentities, possibly does a small favor by stopping somewhere. Why wouldn't you give at least 1.00 or more? Obviously they are saving you more than that few dollar tip you could give. I totally understand the driver gets paid. But by now you surely have heard that drivers are not making much $ like they used to. After Uber takes their 25%, then 2.00/2.60 booking fee, and then the ""others fee"" usually .25 to .99.  What the driver actually receives isnt much. Lets not forget gas, oil changes, taxes, ride share insurance, wear & tear on car (trans fluid, tires, other fluids, etc) Not that its your fault or problem but assuming you are a somewhat decent person why dont you feel the need to tip a few dollars for a service well done? I am curious why some riders tip and others dont. If you dont tip for rideshare but tip waitress, bar tender, etc... Why someone who hands you a shot & beer, or your dinner on a plate versuses a driver who takes all the risk, gets you around safely, and saves you money?"
RIDERS: What are some of your reasons for not tipping a driver?,MaryStyles,10669,RIDERS:Whata,"Do passengers who barf in the car get negative ratings? I bet they do.Here's a role-reversal.  Last year when I was getting back from college for Thanksgiving break, the barfing was committed by the driver. Yes, the driver.  It was about a 25 minute ride from the station, and he and I were chatting about Thanksgiving and our plans. Everything was fine until he got completely silent and stopped responding to me questions. I could see him lean in towards the steering wheel, throw his head back once, then put his right hand to cover his mouth.  He was starting to pull over, but it was too late, vomit-ville in his hand and splattered the front seats. I felt horrible.Just for the record, I wasn't charged the cleaning fee (thank gosh, LOL), and I actually refrained to NOT rate the driver. I felt too awful."
RIDERS: What are some of your reasons for not tipping a driver?,momof4,10671,10669,"Oh no I would've been super embarrassed. I wonder when he threw up,  if you had a weak stomach it made you throw up, if he would'vd reported it to Uber. Lol That really wouldnt be funny but I could see some drivers doing something like that. If that way me while driving I wouldve tried to grab a barf bag. Then I wouldve apologized profusely and refunded your money on the app. I couldnt even imagine. That was super nice of you not to rate him. I didnt gave my pukey riders 5 stars.  I knew I would never be paired with the New Years people because of their location and where I normally drive. I did however shoot Uber a message asking them not to pair them with me again. They said yes. We all make mistakes no sense in trashing their rating."
RIDERS: What are some of your reasons for not tipping a driver?,CrazyCrayons,10670,10669,You probably should have reported him. He was probably tipsy from his Thanksgiving festivities.
RIDERS: What are some of your reasons for not tipping a driver?,Wes,10550,RIDERS:Whata,"As a passenger, I expect only two things.1.  A clean car - and I mean a truly CLEAN car.  Yes the floormats can be soiled from today's traffic, but NOT from two weeks ago with filthy carpet around them.  And yes, I do prefer to look at the windows so PLEASE, wipe the interior windows down once a week or two.  And no, I don't want to play with your kids toys scattered about the back seat and back window.  And yes, I DO need the AC running when it's in the 70's outside (or warmer) and NO i don't ever want the windows rolled down.2.  Drive the speed limit and obey the laws.  Come to a complete stop at stop signs.  You don't need to be the fastest car in the left lane on the interstate - just drive safely and comfortably with the flow of traffic.  Remember, YOU get paid for TIME and miles, so there's really no reason to drive unsafely, you're actually costing yourself money.  And I pay the same no matter how long you take."
RIDERS: What are some of your reasons for not tipping a driver?,momof4,10553,10550,"Be nice if everyone thought like you:). Over the summer I seen a few taxi cabs on I 95 with passengers windows rolled down. I will assume at passengers request,  at least I hope. I had a rider tell me he was on his way to work in an Uber temp was 85 hot & humid driver had no air on. I dont understand what would make you think anyone would want to sit in a hot , stuffy car. Thank you for sharing Wes."
RIDERS: What are some of your reasons for not tipping a driver?,BiggestBallOfYawn,10781,10550,"So what you are saying is that anything outside of those two things is ""extra"" and you should tip for them?  This is assuming you expect these two things and you wouldn't tip for these two check boxes being ticked off.  (I agree with that.)"

Before Uber/Lyft if I took a taxi I tipped 20% on top of the high priced fare.

Why would I tip a bartender 20% for bringing me drinks but not tip my driver who drove me home safely and saved me from a DUI and got me home safely?  People in service industry work for tips. Taxi drivers were always tipped 20% on top of the high priced fare unless the rider was cheap. Just dont see how this any different if not a better, cheaper, easier solution than ordering a taxi.

This bothers me as it is really the only way us drivers have to check the validity of our riders. Riders can check the license plate, car color, car make/model, etc. Have you had any passengers do this to you yet?"
Have you had any #whatsmyname passengers yet?,momof4,12922,Haveyouhadan,Every rider we pick up is a safety issue. We dont know what these riders are capable of doing especially under the influence. Do Uber and Lyft cate about drivers safety? Absolutely not. Lyft especially lets riders use fake names on their profile. Every rider should have to have a pic on their profile that we can see. Sometimes it comes up on Lyft.  Not that this helps much but better than what we get now. Uber and Lyft do not background check riders. I will not pick up any rider with a fake name or in another language.  Few weeks ago got this request. Pinged me 3X over 20 minutes declined 3X. Idiot probably windering why its taking so long to have his request accepted. Its also probably a minor or a jerk.

At least leave me with one safety feature ""your name"".  So far I've only had one difficult passenger a drunk 30 something female with her drunk husband. Even the husband told her to be quiet and chill. There are no stories out there about female drivers killing, raping, kidnapping riders so chances are I am not a threat especially at my age:) Of course the passenger rated me at 4 stars.

Uber I've been lucky only had 1 with just a letter M.  Rating was good and it was a long trip. I did take the chance. Paid off. Really sweet older couple who tipped 20%. It's mostly lyft I see bogus names. Most of my rides are families, pilots, business people, college kids, and families going to the airport or coming into the airport. No, dont wait in queues. Lol I am picky on my rides. I found an area to drive to pick these types of people up and can usually tell where they are going.  Lyft gives me 30+ min long trip or 45+ min long trip when request pings my phone. Uber gives me 42 min, 47 min, 52 min long trip, etc.. when request pings my phone. By doing it this way I feel safer. People travelling and paying $60.00+ for a trip tends not to be a problem. Some have the ""your just a driver"",  attitude or ""I make big bucks I am better than you"", or ""I am President of my Co. and you are hired help"". I can deal with them:)"

This isn’t reliable at all.I’d hate for the code thing. Can we just check the vehicle information and license plate that rely on state mandated info and be okay with it?As for protecting the drivers, yeah, that part makes sense.

When I pull up I ask the rider their name, if it matches what I have I will then give my name and verify destination. Riders have enough info on us to keep them safe.

Although not the best check we have a background check riders do not. I am a female driver chances of me kidnapping or hurting a rider are slim.

Also find me an Uber story that a woman killed, raped, or beat a passenger. These people are so ridiculous . Waiting for my 1 star. Uber is getting a report on them. Not that it matters but want no chance being matched with them again. I understand the girl who was killed had friends that wanted to  do something but ""say my name"" is all wrong.

Leaving at 4am for SFO from East Bay are uber & Lyft available?,chawes,20004,Leavingat4am,Yes you can. However with uber it's just going to make the ride request for you in time for 4am. You are not reserving a driver.With Lyft they'll actually let drivers commit to the ride ahead of time. So I'd lean toward doing this with Lyft rather than Uber.

Give them a barf bag and ensure they can use it if they need it.  I also tell them that if they puke it is going to cost A LOT of money! IF they need to puke I wil stop and they can get out.I find it hard to believe that after 20 pukes, it is even possible to ride in your vehicle with the windows closed.  At that point I would have removed all the carpet and ensured all the seats were vinly or leather.In no way am I wishy washy about it either.Lastly, no open containers.   Perioud."

Not all states are actually in compliance with that federal law. In other words not all states actually have this law that they are required to have. 39 states are in complete compliance, and 4 more do ban it, but not quite to the level of compliance with that federal law.

Banned from charging Uber cleaning fee?,AsStibelDude,5330,5230,"You only drive on the weekdays?  Smart.  That's how drivers get their say and dictate their day/preference.  I like that about Uber.  I knew of a retiree who just wanted the leisurely drive of Saturday and Sunday mornings.  he enjoyed his 5 hour shifts tremendously.Then again, it may be different for a fulltime driver.  I drive over 50 hours a week, and M-Th are the slow days and don't make real money.  I often find that working 6 hours on Friday and 6 hours on Saturday can yield as much as I make in a whole work week.  I guess it depends on where you are."

I assume they are talking about cash tip because you rate passenger before you can see if they tipped. I have gotten tips added at end of night up to 2 weeks after. That is just rediculous to take stars, tips are great and appreciated but not mandatory. As drivers we complain about riders rating us low for stupid reasons but some drivers out there are doing the same thing. I can honestly say there has been less than a handful of times I wanted to rate a passenger less than 5 stars in over 1200 trips. The only reason I didn't is because we have to swipe stars immediately and then give reason I don't have time for that most nights. Wish we could give rating at end if shift. The star rating is awful Uber also needs to let us know when we get less than 5 stars why the passenger rated us less than 5 because how do you fix something when you have no clue what you did?Read less..."

And to be honest, greeted with such ambivalence I am inclined not to tip, but I always do, on the app, either 15 or 20%.. I don't carry cash so it's always on the app. I also always leave 5 stars, except one extremely bad driver who shouted into a phone for the entire 30 minute trip and drove like a maniac, but even then I didn't leave a bad rating, rather no rating at all.So that leads me to my behavior. I'm the type of person who is always punctual and organized, there have been no issues with drivers having difficulty finding me, and I'm quick to load my luggage and get in the back seat with care not to slam or scuff. I always wear a mask, greet the driver with a thank you, some small talk if they want. If I'm tired from a long trip and don't want to talk I tell them they're welcome to put on a radio station of their choice. I've never asked for climate control, or opened the window at highway speed, I'm usually dressed business casual and don't smell (no cologne, not a smoker or drinker), I can't remember ever speaking on the phone during a trip. I used to say I will tip them on the app as I got out of the car (and always did) but I've read I should never say that for some reason, so I stopped. I do often tell them I plan to give five stars, and thank them for the ride, and again I don't slam the door because I hate when people do that in my car. I ride on my company's Uber account but I don't think the driver can see that or that it would make any difference. I live in a busy part of Brooklyn where the driver can always pick up another fare instantaneously. I do not eat or drink in the car, if anything I am usually quiet underway because I'm tired and I sometimes rest my eyes or just look out the window. If the driver wants to talk I always oblige, and I have listened to some crazy conspiracy theories while just nodding my head, occasionally there is a wonderful, thoughtful chat we both seem to enjoy, but never an argument..So I am mystified why I have such a low rating. Is it because they're all airport trips? Do the drivers perceive me poorly because I'm white and they are Indian/Bangladeshi/Pakistani - I wouldn't think so? A couple days ago I took a $129 surge ride home from Newark airport, tipped 15%, my rating is still 4.5. Am I supposed to start preparing dinner for these guys and reading a bedtime story or what? I've only one time sensed the driver was upset (the shouting guy who I didn't rate) otherwise every driver seemed cordial and content, and yet they are giving me poor ratings, for what I really can't imagine. Can anyone enlighten me please?The sad thing is now that I'm aware of my plummeting rating I really don't want to give 5 stars or tip anymore, but I do because everybody has to eat. In my opinion this Uber rating system is just bad business, it has no real criteria, can be purely based on looks or race or perceived entitlement and has caused me to no longer enjoy riding. I should probably just stop looking at it, but it irks me that drivers are passing up my fare for no good reason, and those who do pick me up have a bad impression of me before I even get in. I've asked my company if they'll open a Lyft account but they are sticking to only Uber.Read less..."

Many formal passengers want to ride in silence which is very rude and super  awkward, and probably many of the drivers on the contrary likes to chatt for fun .Still, as a human being  need to contact with each other showing a human interactions  with a nice and friendly attitude treating each other with respect . I always rating those kind of the nice humble riders 5 stars if they are friendly and socialize with a sense of hummer  by joking and  having a small chatting with the riders trying not ignoring them if they want to talk which make me fill having good time doing my job keeping entertained getting treated as a spacial super star which make me so excited and also keeping our vehicle clean with no mess or damages  or eating and drinking inside making a mess  .if the riders do not engage in conversations I will downrate them with 2 to 3 stars maximum for being formal ,rude and jerks with arrogant behavior acting like they are bossy treating the drivers as a slave especially if they jumped to my car asking me to take them to their destination  without saying ""Hello"" and also if they are not talkative being so quite during the trip entertaining themselves by  texting or talking on the cell or people and also if they are talking among to each other with people inside my car ignoring me instead of chatting with me which is really awkward and super rude ,getting frustrating and makes me feel like a machine doing my job which not nice at all to be rude and disrespectful with no reason .Those kind of riders need to understand Uber is a community service not like a taxi cab service taking them from point A to B  making a space between the riders and drivers.Also it's very annoying ,super awkward and very rude for being quite not chatty or chatting among to each other keep the driver ignored and also when they ask the driver turning on the radio very loud beside ignoring the drivers chatting among to each other so that they deserve 2 stars for misbehave with no respect for the friendly Uber drivers and their vehicle . So if the riders want to be a good 5 star rating passenger they need to make that "" Don't Ignore your friendly Uber driver "".If the riders are looking for a quite service with a quite formal driver without being sociable and friendly avoiding getting a bad star rating for being formal with a drivers all the time during the trip taking them only from point A to point B just to have a relaxation doing their own privacy by making a space or a wall between the drivers not communicating with them without a friendly atmosphere such as : listening to the music or playing a video on the cell phone and also texting or talking on the phone without an excuse or doing their own entertainment by chatting among to each other ....etc ,it's much better to take a public transport up such as a taxi cab , shuttle , bus or luminous with those formal quite drivers . However ;those cab drivers are unfriendly with their passenger , busy and making a space always who are not talkative with there passenger as long they are looking for a quite and relaxation service like that and also they don't have any friendly greeting their riders like us as an Uber's partners.However;If those arrogant riders ignoring us as a friendly drivers like to have a quite ride with your phone texting ,talking and chatting with peploe with you keeping the uber driver ignored by treating us as a server or slave its will be better for them to take a public transport up such as a taxi cab , shuttle , bus or luminous which is fair enough if they don't show us any friendly treatment with a respect as a human being .That's what riders need with a mutual respect to be nicer and friendly and to treat the driver with courtesy say"" hello,how are you"" . Some of the driver love having a small talk with their riders and many of the drivers don't like a quite riders which make them feel uncomfortable .However; if the rider would like to be chatty with a driver or not It's optional they don't always have to if the rider want a quite ride , but still riders need be more respectful if they don't want to be removing poorly rated passengers drops below 4.0  from the app .Be a good friendly Uber rider with your driver please !!!!!Read less..."

Gets in car doesnt say hello and barks orders between sentences to caller. Stop here, go there and just continues to call everyone in their contacts. They speak loudly and repeat ""like, umm, cool"". After making a stop for them dont even say thank you or at the end of a trip. I am sure drivers out there no the type. They are on an expense account (even their 1st class flight, high end hotel), have that self entitled attitude, basically treat you like you are the lowely hired help beneath them. Had one to JFK last week. Right before trip my daughter calls and tells me she may have cancer. So my mind is racing as is.  Stopped not once but twice. No thank you from rider. Listened to him talk about some gross thing on his side and how he wanted to pick it and if he said like or cool one more time I would've choked him.  Worried about my daughter. Cant pick up anyone in NY, it was rush hour (traffic never good but rush hour is a nightmare), and not only did his attitude suck but didnt tip a dime. Karma bit him in the ass. As he exited my car he  dropped his laptop on the concrete:) No my daughter didnt have cancer she misunderstood doctor when she said she has some abnormal cells that needed to be watched. Just mentioned that to make a point how people get in your car treat you like dirt and they just dont care. Does it kill a rider or driver to say hi, how are you, how is your day? Of course I wouldnt blurt out my daughter may have cancer but it would be nice for everyone to treat each other with kindness and respect. Suppose your rider just found out they or their family member had cancer or some other terrible thing happened would ot kill you to be nice? Or to listen to them? Yes, i know you dont get paid to. Just the decent thing to do. I know another driver who was taking rider to airport so he could get to his dying brother.  Hot the call on the way there he died. The driver said he was sorry and listened to the guy for a few minutes. Just doing a nice thing because. He received a $20.00 tip.Read less..."

Do Uber and Lyft drivers mind picking up another passenger if it means they have to wait 5 to 10 minutes?,SmittenKitten,3624,DoUberandLyf,"As I read these responses, I think the answer depends on a few things:a) How busy the night is.Yes, drivers do make money while driving and when the vehicle is moving.  So, if it's a busy night, they'd rather be doing that.  Some are saying, ""it's better than making $0.00"", but that logic only works if there aren't other passengers out there.b) Whether the driver drives an UberX, UberXL, UberBlack, or UberSUV.The per minute fee is quite different between these services.  In Boston, UberX makes $0.21/minute ($12.6/hr), UberXL $0.35/minute ($21/hr), UberBlack $0.45/minute ($27/hr), and UberSUV $0.50/minute ($30/hr).  UberX drivers would be at a disadvantage and perhaps be grumpy, but UberSUV guys probably don't mind nearly as much.c) Location probably matters.The per minute fee is also different from city to city.  For example, Boston UberX drivers get paid $0.21/minute but those in San Diego make $0.15/minute.  That's a big difference.  You may argue that there is a cost of living adjustment, but $0.15/minute is $9 per hour before Uber takes its cut."
Do Uber and Lyft drivers mind picking up another passenger if it means they have to wait 5 to 10 minutes?,rectorma34,4704,3624,"Definitely depends on how busy the night is! That is always key, if it is a slow night, I do not mind at all."
Do Uber and Lyft drivers mind picking up another passenger if it means they have to wait 5 to 10 minutes?,RPaulson,3614,DoUberandLyf,"We are your personal driver.What you are doing is exactly what we are hired to be doing.  In my mind, it's definitely ok to stop at a place, you tell me to wait, and you pick up someone.  and remember, we get paid for the time waiting as well.Some drivers get grumpy?  I don't think they are in the right profession then.  Yes, we'd make more money while driving, but we make zero while not having a customer.  We should be happy to be making money for the time spent.Also, when we are waiting, we don't consume fuel/gas.  So, the profit margin goes up."

I usually kill my engine to save fuel, and we are good.Yes, time is money for Uber drivers, but worst wasted time is bewtween rides and waiting for rides where we make $0.00 an hour.   When I am on the clock, I am always happy.  I will wait for 2 hours, if you want me to."

Why can't we be honest?  I absolutely hate waiting around and I know many other drivers do too.I get whopping $0.15 a minute and that's before Uber takes its 25% cut. (Maybe it's better in other cities.) That's like $6 an hour, lower than minimum wage.  I hear other drivers saying it's better than not having a passenger, but it sucks compared to when we are driving a passenger.We get paid the most while driving and the vehicle moving.  On a busy night, this kils productivity and earnings.    If I sat around all night waiting for people picking up their dates, I wouldn't be able to earn a living.Please just complete the trip and order another one.  That isn't that hard, right?  Booking fee is like $2 to $3."

Wow, that's low.  Obviously an uberX, but where are you?   We get $0.21 in Boston.I see various driver responses here, but I think it depends on whether the driver drives a UberX/XL vs. UberBlack/SUV.  The per minute rate differs significantly."

I don't think your date really cares if it's Steve or John waiting in the car.  The base fare is like $3.  If it takes you 10 minutes to pick her up, you already spent that on wait time.  Let the driver go make his money.  Why punish the unlucky guy who picked you up."

What can your riders do to make your life a little easier?,fpressly,Whatcanyourr,0,"Make themselves readily findable. Help the driver to find them quickly and easily by text or calling. Treat the driver with the same dignity and respect they would like to be shown. Be personable and reasonable in your demands. Recognize the driver as an individual trying desperately to get ahead of their status quo and needing uplifting and encouragement just like the next guy. Tip ride share drivers like they are a bartender or restaurant wait staff. Believe me they have far more personal expenses driving this vehicle and responsibilities for your safety than either of those groups and you tip bartenders and waitstaff unhesitatingly 20–25%. No matter the length of the ride, I NEVER tip less than a five dollar bill. Being able to get from anywhere to anywhere with fifteen minutes notice at a comparatively cheap rate, is worth at least that to me in spades. OMG $5, that is a Starbucks people. Get a clue, these people make a TOUGH living and please stop living in the 90’s when two dollars meant something. We’re almost in the 2020’s, now it takes five. That’s the reality of the situation.

I mean really A-hole, uneducated mother F*** peace of SH#%#T!!!! REALLY!!!I said Ok and carried on. The next day all DVMs and every store and every place on earth shut down due to COVID-19. So, I could not go to DVM or even drive or do anything. I waited till July and took the time and visited DMV and got a new DL along with a letter from state of secretary that states when my DL was issued and my record has been super clean. Those documents cost me $29 and I had to drive around with a stupid temp DL until I got my real new DL in the mail. Went back to stupid Uber Greenlight in-person again. The same person who spoke to me last time was there. He remembered me. I showed him all the new documents and the letter he requested. They uploaded all the BS to whatever special team they have. It has been almost a week and no word of any kind. My account is still deactivated. I have a feeling this is not going to resolve and it was a total waist of F*** time and money spent.I care less to drive for Uber and as matter a fact ever since I have been with Lyft for past ~4 years I used Uber occasionally. I am just wondering if Lyft does not have an issue with my DL and the police officers don’t have an issue with my DL and every other government facility does not have an issue with my DL ... why the F*** Uber is having an issue with my DL and accuse me of submitting a fraudulent document?I have yet to meet again the stupidest and most pathetic people as I have met the ones I met with in the Greenlight hub. I have yet to comprehend an Uber support phone rep. That is the only job they are capable of and are the lowest human beings I have ever seen. A donkey has a better manner and brain than the Greenlight Uber reps - seriously.Anyway folks, looks like I got pinned for the same crap you guys have and I just wish I knew what I really did wrong for my app to get deactivated after 5+ years of nothing but AWESOME service for every single 7000 plus rides I have completed.I just stick with Lyft and do my hardest and best to weaken Uber in all my power.If anyone here has an update on your Uber document “fraudulent” story please post here.

Summarily fired by Uber after they (falsely) claimed I altered documents. No recourse.,KrisMarcs,18934,18441,"Lyft is known to thin out the drivers when their business isn't doing well. They make weird reasoning and basically stop returning your calls.They do this in markets where they feel are too many drivers, because they feel average pay is becoming too low.In some markets, they have to report the average pay to the authorities and if it falls under a certain threshold, they have to control the # of drivers. Technically, they don't have to have a reason to fire their drivers, (as it is all independent contractors with no benefits), but it's been brutal for many.It also plays into their publicity too. If drivers in certain markets say they are only getting paid $10,000 a year, it'll be more difficult for them to find drivers in markets the drivers are scarce."

Ambassadors from Other Cities: The Global Culture of Cab Drivers,Samarov,Ambassadorsf,0,"*In 2003 the Public Chauffeur Training Institute was located at Harold Washington College on Lake Street downtown. This was the place you had to go if you wanted to become a taxi or limo driver in the city of Chicago.

While I wasn’t a newly arrived immigrant to this city and country like the majority of my classmates, I still hadn’t quite found my place here even twenty-five years after my arrival from the Soviet Union.

Our teacher, a retired driver, wanted us to tell what we knew of each other’s cultures. When we went around the room introducing ourselves, racial and ethnic prejudices were given full voice. It was mostly for laughs and to break the ice but it was quite clear that few of us knew much about other tribes and what little we did know wasn’t flattering. The Africans were likely cannibals, the Southeast Asians all smelled and I—as the lone Jew of the bunch—undoubtedly owned a bank and was just slumming it. We all laughed and reassured one another that here in America we were all after the same thing.One of the refrains of the two-week course was about how in Chicago cab drivers were “Ambassadors to the City.” It was our job to present our town to visitors in the best possible light. According to the handout we were made to repeat out loud in unison over and over, we were to be some combination of tour guide and civic booster to each and every passenger getting into our cab at O’Hare, Midway or Union Station. What did any of us actually know about this city aside from being from elsewhere and finding ourselves here in need of some way to get by? That would remain to be seen.Over the nine years that I drove, I rarely ran into my classmates. Most don’t stick with it very long. The two-week class hardly prepares you for the actual job. It takes months to even begin to make sense of it, let alone earn any money at it. When we would run into each other, though, there might be a slight nod, a half smile, but not much more. It’s a solitary thing, driving a cab and each of us was in it to get elsewhere as fast as we could. To talk to each other would be to acknowledge that we had stuck around longer than we had intended; it was more or less to acknowledge our failure to find any better way to make a living.At the airports, cabstands and all-night restaurants where cab drivers congregated, most typically stuck to their own kind. Pakistanis might break bread with Indians but would do so less often with Eastern Europeans or Africans, and the same would hold true for most races and ethnicities. The American melting pot had not had its way with this bunch quite yet. Every so often there were exceptions. Differently colored and clothed men could sometimes be seen strolling together up and down the rows of taxis at the O’Hare Staging Area. The African food truck parked by the cabstand at the Sheraton boasted customers from every continent. The managers and other employees at the garage—often former drivers—hailed from every country imaginable.The Public Chauffeur Training Institute moved to Olive-Harvey College on the far South Side a few years back, but I have no doubt that at the beginning of every new course the students break the ice more or less like mine did in 2003. They’ll joke about where they’re from and promise one another that they’ll only drive for a year or two until something better comes along. They’ll learn the city and share it with their passengers the best they can. Each will represent Chicago as a mixture of where they came from and where they’d like to go; every tick of the taxi meter taking them a little closer to their next destination, wherever that may be.Read less..."

"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",SF2016,Gunputtomyhe,0,"I just had an incident Monday night driving for Uber, and despite an initial quick response, they have not responded to 4 emails back to their email.Myself and two of my Uber Pool passengers had guns put to our heads and were robbed of our valuables (phones, wallets, etc). Two guys in a car sped up and passed us on the wrong side of the street, blocked us in, ran towards us with guns and put one to the back of my head as they demanded we give them our stuff. Then they drove off.I have a number of concerns with Uber's handling of this situation, how it should be handled, whether they are going to help me replace my phone, etc.I see now that Oakland is still the most dangerous city in N CA and even with the gentrification that can be seen, the very real dangers still exist in various parts despite what appears to be a fresh new mix of people.They think nothing of sending drivers into the neighborhoods to provide their service. When workers work in dangerous conditions they are made aware of the the risks, they are informed of what to do in various circumstances, and basically receive training for safety. Uber says nothing of the dangers drivers should be aware of, they don't inform drivers of how to best handle possible robbery situations at gunpoint, etc. Yet they freely send us, and other unsuspecting rideshare passengers into one of the most dangerous cities in the USA and say nothing to help us keep ourselves safe should we encounter a gun put to the back our head.Suggestions? Clearly they would not ignore this if it were an ""employee""...LM"

It's helpful for the police to track it immediately. I was able to (hours later) lock my phone remotely from my laptop and send the police it's last know location. It got the job done but a couple hours late.Uber's insurance company contacted me to find out if my vehicle was damaged but since it wasn't nothing more was done from them. And based on the news that came out today on Uber's crime investigation department, they appear to be on one track only, covering their own liability exposure. As a contractor, I don't think they intend to follow up with me anymore now that they know there was no physical injuries or vehicle damage. I doubt they care about replacing my $800 phone.Rule of thumb is: They use the drivers and we're just a means to an end and they try to minimize their liabilities with us.***Their response seemed reasonable at first until you look closer and see their complete lack of attention to the facts. She says she called me... Which part of ""they took my phone"" was overlooked. I've sent 4 emails after this asking what's next and no one has responded with anything. ""... launched an internal investigation""... Did you see today's article about Uber’s investigation team? They don't report crimes to the police if we tell them, that lies in our hands, their priority is to limit Uber’s legal liability first, previous team members complained of burn out, etc. They don't seem to be an any condition, or have an interest in anyone's well being, just covering their exposure.""Thank you for reporting this situation, Louie. We tried reaching you at the number associated with your Uber account. Our team has launched an internal investigation and someone will be in contact with you as soon as possible regarding this matter.If you choose to reach out to law enforcement you may have the official you are working with submit their request for information atlert.uber.comat their earliest convenience. We have a dedicated Law Enforcement Response Team that handles all information requests.If you have further details about this incident that you would like to share with us in the meantime, please feel free to respond to this message. We look forward to speaking with you soon""Looks all good until you don't hear from them again...***Thanks for the support below. No, I didn't have a dash cam in this vehicle. Police report was filed right after, I provided them with my phone's last location but hadn't followed up with them. I have sent messages to several press outlets and waiting to see if there are responses.So a variety of things have been done and I'm waiting on replies. I'm also sharing the experience with pool riders, they need to ge aware of where their other riders are taking them, which neighborhoods they end up passing through etc. They can't take it for granted that they're safe, that's one giant false sense of security they seem to have.-Just saw a couple more posts come through, I'll reply normally there...Read less..."
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",Uberserge,16983,Gunputtomyhe,Do you have a dash cam? It's always the best proof! Invest in a double view one where it records outside and inside the car simultaneously.
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",momof4,16990,Gunputtomyhe,Just looked this up to see if it made it to the media. I dont see anything. If I were you I would call your local news station. Maybe they will respond then. Also I heard if you put complaints on twitter they respond.
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",Uberserge,16991,16990,"I tweeted it, let's see. There's a panic button on my app, I told this driver how to use it on a previous post."
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",sharknado,16986,Gunputtomyhe,"Holy crap. This is my worst nightmare. You're right, Uber should be handling this somehow.Taxis in my city always have a big thick plastic shield in front of the back seat. For this reason. Not bulletproof but enough to keep physical barrier between driver and pax and prevent any grappling etc. Maybe someone needs to market these for uber drivers. Uber should give them to people driving in high risk areas."
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",momof4,16988,Gunputtomyhe,Sorry you hsd to go through this. I cant even imagine how you and your passengers felt. I cant say that I am surprised by how Uber is handling this. Obviously I dont agree with it. I am assuming you called the police? As a driver I know Uber dont care about us and we are on our own out there. If I were you I would go to the press. Unfortunately if we dont make these issues known nothing will ever be done about it. I try to stay out of those neighborhoods unfortunately nowhere is safe and its not easy to stay out of them. Have they been able to track your phones? What have the police done if anything?Were you or passengers able to get a license plate or any descriptions? Did you have a dashcam? If you didnt and decide to continue to drive please invest in one. Again sorry you had to go through this. Thankfully none of you were physically injured. What about going to your local Hub? I dont think you will get anywhere my just messaging them. Best of luck.
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",dracomalfoy,16985,Gunputtomyhe,"Wow, did you get the contact info of your pool pax? I am curious if they have contacted Uber and if so if they have had more luck? Did you contact police?"
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",Uberserge,16981,Gunputtomyhe,"Uber doesn't care, I'm very sorry about what you went through. I hope you filed a police report. You do know there's a panic button on your driver app now? E-mails won't do it. Click on your driver picture, then the help button next to the question mark, scroll down you'll see an emergency number. Call that immediately. Thank God you and your passengers are all right."
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",Bigfrank,17253,Gunputtomyhe,I would definitely seek legal counsel and thank God your safe and alive

Better awareness of dangerous locations and training isn't too much to ask for. Uber has the crime data that they track, but they don't disclose it, not a surprise.B) Passengers: Better awareness, I don't think passengers understand the risks they take on pool rides. Uber is setting up the transaction, but they also should understand that Uber will state they're not at fault, they're just a tech company, the ""contractor"" is in charge when they on a ride. We all need to wake up to our own responsibilities in these transactions.The phone... Sure they can say it's not their problem, they can look at their ""legal"" obligation and say f*ck off, we're in the clear.  But as much as they claim to be there for the  drivers and passengers a humane thing might be to reach out and say hey, let us cover that loss.I understand better, we don't work for Uber, we work for ourselves, sounds simple enough, and we should know better.

Then you get a text saying “I’ll be there in three minutes!” Three minutes later, no car. You cancel, and get assessed a $5 fee. The driver repeats the process all day while listening to soccer."
"Lots of Driver Scams - Watch out, passengers!",mboscorelli,6831,1555,"There is a variation of this.  After 5 minutes, the driver can cancel and mark it as ""no show"", and drive off with arms raised in a V."

"Lots of Driver Scams - Watch out, passengers!",silicon66666,3634,1555,Hate to break it to you but that happened to me this afternoon on Lyft. He sat around just 1 minute away and not moving. Wouldn’t answer his phone after calling him THREE TIMES and drove away entirely after I waited literally 10 minutes for him to do something. I already know about the cancellation fee and REFUSED to cancel (my wife works for Lyft). Idiot went up and nearly crossed state lines while still waiting for me to cancel. Finally he cancelled on his end after 25 minutes (no joke. I had to use a friends phone to order a separate Lyft. Kept my phone on the whole time - I ended up just chilling out in my bedroom before he finally gave up). It switched my driver and I was then allowed to cancel with the fee being waived. Immediately got a hold of driver support and also emailed/corresponded with customer service.EDIT : Thank god their license plate number shows up. Not everyone would think to save that.
"Lots of Driver Scams - Watch out, passengers!",CurbDigger,3641,3634,"Nah, the worst is when the driver drives to your location, but hides around the corner, waits like 5 minutes, and then cancels claiming a NO-SHOW.  Then you get charged like $5 or whatever as a (rider) cancellation fee.This no-show cancellation happened to me twice.  One may have been an innocent mistake as I live in an apartment complex with multiple buildings.  The guy was answering my texts too.  I think he just gave up on me.  The other time?  not a peep from my driver.  I never cancelled but he did, and I got dinged with a cancellation.  Whaa....."

"Lots of Driver Scams - Watch out, passengers!",robot.deloch,19062,1555,This is so bad in my city. All the driver really wants to do is cancel so they can collect and move on the the next passenger.

I could write a long list of things passengers do to get their fare refunded, get driver in trouble or deactivated, and many other things they do that are dishonest. The crap some of these passengers pull are rediculous. One of my favorites that happens all the time is ""my friend just lives a few blocks can you drop them off or its on the way""? Happens to me every weekend on bar pick ups. There are many more things and when I first started driving I got caught up in a few of their lies.

"Lots of Driver Scams - Watch out, passengers!",Bigfrank,5111,LotsofDriver,The scams started with uber then downstreamed to tightwad passengers then app drivers returned it back upstream.
"Lots of Driver Scams - Watch out, passengers!",ShellyGarant,11468,5111,Whats wrong with that? If that driver got the ping for a ride he or she is still the closest driver. Pants on or off it takes 5 seconds to put them on. Better that make the streets busier and waste gas. Right?
"Lots of Driver Scams - Watch out, passengers!",MickDorsey,11480,11468,Which comment are you responding to?  Are you referring to how some drivers wait for a ping while sitting in their homes?That’s too funny. I’m sure many do it. Say in suburbs.
"Lots of Driver Scams - Watch out, passengers!",momof4,11518,11480,I usually sit at a gas station 2 blocks from my house waiting for rides when I start my shift. My house is 2 blocks from the gas station. Why would it matter if I sit at the gas station or sit at my house? It takes me 30 secs to go out start my car and head to pick up. If I am in my house or at the gas station its taking me same time to get there.   I am not getting paid til rider is in my car and start the trip. Why should Uber or rider dictate or care where I wait? Not costing them anything. Also no rules on Uber where you can and cant sit while waiting for rides. Before a driver accepts a trip they are on their own time.
"Lots of Driver Scams - Watch out, passengers!",LG-PA,11510,11480,"I often have both apps on and am doing things around the home (live in suburbs), Of course I know that if a ping comes in I am to leave home within 2 minutes and head over"
"Lots of Driver Scams - Watch out, passengers!",Bigfrank,10444,LotsofDriver,Scamming although unethical would be almost unheard of if these deplorable app companies didn't scam  their drivers by lowering rates and not adding a auto tip . Secondly  many passengers would trade their mother for a chocolate bar if  it was in their favor to do so . The subject matter is pointless because you can hop in a metered taxi or on mass transit because the getting over days is coming to a end especially in NYC.

I am a female driver so my experience may be different than a males driver perspective but it is not very easy to have relations with your passengers in my opinion! Many trips are fairly short, you hardly get past the friendly how are you chatter before you are on to the next passenger. Many people travel in multiples making a situation of cheating even more unlikely.Does your husband drive at night often? I would think this would be a time for more temptation (drunk passengers) but again most girls will travel in groups at night.Do you have any reasons to suspect your husband? Has he been unfaithful before? Have you found any evidence in his car?Could your husband pick up another job to earn extra income? Perhaps a delivery driver where he hardly interacts with others?"

My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,Fishman,17395,Myhubbyisari,"Highly unlikely. As the 2 lady drivers basically say below, it’s superficial conversations to keep passengers happy, the passenger wants to get somewhere in terms of location, not in terms of relationship, and anyway, I don’t want to creep out my female passengers. I can sometimes get passengers who talk quite personal stuff, but I don’t initiate and I don’t probe with questions, again because I don’t want to creep them out. We have guidelines on communicating with passengers. Flirty language is not allowed. I’d hope passengers who feel uncomfortable with a driver’s conversation reported them as those drivers give the rest of us a bad name."
My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,chocolove,17386,Myhubbyisari,"I'm curious as to why you think he is cheating. In my opinion, if someone is a cheater they will always find a situation in which they can cheat. By making him quit rideshare driving will do nothing for your relationship. Most jobs involve working with others and working with others of the opposite sex, perhaps you need to look deeper into your relationship to overcome these feelings."
My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,bettybop482,17385,Myhubbyisari,Why do you live in another state? Is rideshare driving all your husband does for work? Can't he drive wherever you are currently living? I would think the distance would be a reason for the relationship strain not the act of rideshare driving.
My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,joeyj,17381,Myhubbyisari,I live and drive in Boston. Trust me not every ride is full of flirty attractive women. I wish it was..it's not like that. I wouldn't worry so much. Plus if you're not even living there why worry so much about how many hours he's driving. He's doing his best for ya. Good luck to you.
My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,bobshmob,17372,Myhubbyisari,"Not trying to be mean here but I think you are being a little too sensitive. Your husband is trying to provide for your family, driving is not fun especially when you have to get back in your car after already working all day. Have you tried to talking to him about this? I don't know your husband but I would think this might be all in your head."

My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,ChatswickFan,17529,Myhubbyisari,"I never thought of this, but driving is such a good excuse for a cheating spouse to leave the house and stay out for an extended period. Unlike a regular job where he needs to be at a specific location and having the hours tracked, driving gives so much freedom of hours and locations."
My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,AsStibelDude,17528,Myhubbyisari,"Well, in general, the demographics of people who take Ubers are younger generation. Not sure about beautiful but younger more affluent people take them, sure.  Then it also depends on where. If your husband chooses to drive in downtown Boston like Back Bay or Financial District, he’d definitely see young female professionals. This is even more true near campuses, like in Cambridge.Not sure if drivers are all that successful in meeting females while driving for Uber but that’s hard to comment specific to your husband. Yes, the encounters are there, but I’m thinking it’s easier to meet someone at a bar than driving for an Uber"
My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,Xtrodinary1,17430,Myhubbyisari,"To be honest, if you think your husband is cheating he probably is or is going to for a few reasons. One, your insecurity is making you less and less attractive to him. No man wants an insecure woman and no woman wants an insecure man. That quality is unacceptable by any standard of humanity, unless for a POMP. Two, the conversations that the two of y'all are going to have, will be focused on everything else besides the two of y'all. The proper focus in a relationship is each person focusing on how to make the other person happy Not how happy is the other person making you. When your so focus on what the other person is or isn't doing you, you lose sight of what your doing to them."

Sooner or later it will bubble out of you, perhaps you can talk to a therapist who can give you some pointers on bringing this up to him? Think about waht you want to achieve.

Your kids dont deserve this.By ignoring the situation its not going to make things any better and will not go away. I know its hard to address it because if he admits it then what? Fear he will leave you, what will you and the kids do, the list goes on? By confronting him and getting it out in the open you can choose to leave him or work on your marriage. Either way you can get on with your life.Not be in the dark, worrying, wondering, all those emotions you have wondering whats going on, what he is doing, who he is with, or what the futures holds. You can work things out if you feel he isnt worth or you can start a new life without him. Start building your new life, its hard but all those fears, the not knowing, the dread of finding out he is cheating all this will be gone. You and the kids can start to heal. You are doung this on your own anyway. He is in another state. I know this is easier said than done but you are stronger than you realize. I've been in your situation. Not exact circumstances but having to choose to be on my own with 4 kids or be in a misearble marriage. Sit down with him dont start throwing accusstions around see if he will come out and admit it. If not tell him whst you have told us here on the forum. Ask him to go to counseling  if thats what you want. How you are living now is no way to live your life.I have a FB page called Deadbeat Dads over 11,000 followers. Although you are not in this situation as far as dad not paying support there are many women on there that have been in your situation. At the very least you can share your story and maybe get some advice from other women. You can post to the page (those post are public)or message me through the page on messenger (private only I see them). It may be a better place than a rideshare forum:) however I will admit that the men who have responded to your post here were respectful and nice:) Thats why I like this forum.

What do you think of the new Uber driver app?,munchkym,Whatdoyouthi,0,The new driver app is out! What do y'all think of it? I've heard some complaints that it's harder to switch between Uber and Lyft with it and complaints that it's harder to find your earnings. Thoughts?
What do you think of the new Uber driver app?,momof4,8399,Whatdoyouthi,I stil want to know what Uber is up to not allowing us to see our acceptance rate or cancellation rate. I dont trust them. It sucks because now I have to take a few pool rides because I dont know what my acceptance rate is. Took a pool tonight turned into 2 riders 11.08 total for both trips 25 min. and 8 miles. Uber made more yet again. WTH.
What do you think of the new Uber driver app?,momof4,8396,Whatdoyouthi,"New app not showing acceptance rate or cancellation rate. Not sure why. Viewed a few video's stating acceptance rate doesnt matter anymore but this is by opinion. I dont know if its true. I just try to keep both of them where I always had them. Who knows what Uber is up to with this. We also have a ""safety feature"" to share trip but that was in old app. They have a 911 in there that you can swipe. By the time you swipe 2X you couldve dialed 911.  It's still better to call 911 with a location. The sad part is if someone truly needs 911 and just uses Uber's app chances are they will not be able to find you just by sending your location from app. Beware police can only track your location in 10% of calls that go out. Please keep that in mind you are better off calling and give your location. I know Septa buses in Philly at one time could change their sign to ""call police"". Would be nice to have something like. There are times obviously that you wouldnt want passenger to know you called police ie. gun to your head. Drive safe, be careful, always be aware of your surroundings. Have a safe night out there."

What do you think of the new Uber driver app?,momof4,8397,Whatdoyouthi,"One of Uber's commercials states that they are making things better for pick up locations. So of course riders see this commercial and think great drivers should have no trouble finding my location because Uber says they are making pick ups better and easier.  NOT. So new driver app rolls out and guess what, it's no better for pick up or drop off. I am still having same issues in apt. complexes, shopping ctrs., malls etc. I just get a request at a train station. Puts pick up in the middle of the road where obviously the passenger is not. It's pouring out. So i call rider and of course she is where cars cannot enter. So I find a spot where I can get her and she can get to me. I totally understand GPS isnt perfect and its not even always Uber's fault. I apologize, she says no worries. Head to destination and Uber directs me right to dead end. So now I have to worry about the good ole 1 star rating although not my fault but rider will see it as my fault. If Uber wants to.put out these things in commercials first make them true stop making drivers look like idiots. Not much better than last one."

Hitting others and being hit as a driver,peter.ashlock,Hittingother,0,"Over the years I have had numerous incidents of being hit by other cars periodically. When I drove a taxi it was something the company took care of as there was never an incident where I was found to be at fault. The only time I ever actually hit a person was one night in the Haight Ashberry neighborhood, carrying a passenger, who yelled, before I saw a man on a bicycle cruise in front of me into an intersection. I hit the man square on, he flew high in the intersection and both bike and man came down hard. I slammed on the brakes and instantly requested assistance from the dispatcher (code blue, I need an ambulence and the police). I was in shock, my passenger left to find another cab and I sat on the curb and burst into tears. Emergency personel arrived quickly and a policeman came over and kicked my foot saying, ""what are you crying for, everyone says it wasn't your fault"".

When I drove a taxi it was something the company took care of as there was never an incident where I was found to be at fault. The only time I ever actually hit a person was one night in the Haight Ashberry neighborhood, carrying a passenger, who yelled, before I saw a man on a bicycle cruise in front of me into an intersection. I hit the man square on, he flew high in the intersection and both bike and man came down hard. I slammed on the brakes and instantly requested assistance from the dispatcher (code blue, I need an ambulence and the police). I was in shock, my passenger left to find another cab and I sat on the curb and burst into tears. Emergency personel arrived quickly and a policeman came over and kicked my foot saying, ""what are you crying for, everyone says it wasn't your fault"". I was startled and said I didn't like hurting people, but was confused as to what happened. I was told witnesses saw the man on the bike eating a burritto as looked away from me while he ran a stop sign, thus driving into my path. The officer told me to come to the station the next day so they could give me a statement to give to the insurance company to absolve me of responsiblity.Later I was hit so hard from behind as I sat at a stop sign that I was shoved half way across the intersection. The drunk who hit me had demolished the front of his car and his face was bloody. I was in shock and got the necessary information but so dazed that when he drove away in the amazingly still running car, I had not had the presence of mind to call for the police, which I should have. In this case, the taxi company took care of everything, except me. I had a serious case of whiplash and any claim of mine I had to deal with by myself. Eventually I hired a lawyer, the insurance company insisted their insured had done nothing wrong as there was only the damage to the cab as indication of the nature of the accident, and they had been having trouble finding their insured. My lawyer suggested I pay to hire a detective to locate the driver, I reluctantly agreed and within a couple of days was informed that he had been found. He had been shot dead on Market Street in San Francisco and the insurance company quickly settled.A few months ago, now driving for Lyft, I was hit by a police car in an apparently distracted driving moment, but of course the police are NEVER at fault and they concocted a scenario to blame me for making an inappropriate turn. This took a contingent of about eight squad cars to make sure the officer was not under attack. I was actually avoiding two other police cars who were attending to police buisness, but that was beside the point to them.What is relevant is that I had get my fender fixed from the damage the police car caused. My insurance paid for the damage but not for the inconvenience or time off necessary to deal with the repair and I was out the  $500 deductable and the lost wages. Typically I don't work on Monday and Tuesday and thus I try to take care of as much business on those days as possible. Every time I have ever had to deal with a fender bender it has taken the body shop five days to do a bumper/fender replacement, so I usually lose a minimum of two work days in the mix. Other than the situaltion with the police, I have been successful on two occasions getting compensated for lost wages. THe insurance company has respected my claims and I submit to them a copy of the record of my earnings to demonstrate what my likely earnings would be if I had not been inconvenienced.I am not so sure how it will play out with a more current incident, where a man hit my car while I was stopped, with my foot on the brake and he tried to parallel park in a space too small. He reeked of pot smoke when we finally exchanged information and his insurance company claim is that I hit him coming around a corner, which could not have happened in the narrow alley where we were both driving. My insurance company is covering the repair, minus my $500 deductable of course, and I will be missing days of work this week, hopefully no more than two. If the company cannot finish the repairs by the end of the day on Friday then I will have to wait until Monday to get the car and I will lose an entire weeks income, plus have to try to get my insurance company to press his company to pay not only my deductable, but also the lost wages.My next question will be how I am to pay the rent on time.Read less..."
Hitting others and being hit as a driver,SyedAli,6184,Hittingother,"Bodyshops do take forever.  I am not surprised by the 5 day turnaround, but what never crossed my mind was the lost wages. Uber or Lyft would certainly not accommodate for that, and I don't even know if they would grant exception on driving a different car for that time period.  Hey, wouldn't that nice?It's the right call to tell the insurance company.  Even if you fail to get the lost wages payout, they may push the bodyshop to perform the work faster.  It would be in their best interest."

I quickly realized I was back in the same business but was now expected to wear a suit and drive a town car.I did that for two years before switching to UberX and Lyft and have noticed how little has changed for one simple reason. People don't change.People still go to work, sullenly, reluctantly and then go home, sometimes with a stop at a bar or a grovery store or to pick up kids, but they go home. Then they go out again. They do these things increasingly as the week progresses until on Thursday evening you have folks who are eager to rehearse their weekend drinking, and on Friday all the people that think that because it's Friday and everyone else is going out they are suppossed to go too. On Saturday, they are nursing a hangover, doing their laundry, buying groceries and trying to line up a date for the evening. Then they go out and go to a restaurant, and or a bar, and or a movie, etc. On Sunday, there is a contingent of mostly younger folks who refuse to let the weekend die easily and contiue to party, but they quit earlier and the city begins to die by nine or so in the evening. On Monday few people go out, on Tuesday, much the same, on Wednesday it's slightly better and on Thursday it all starts again. They do these activities until the bars close and they are forced to go home.People have been performing this pattern for a very long time. It is exactly the way it was when I was first driving a taxi in the mid seventies and today nothing is different except for the illusion that because of the wonders of the digital age, somehow Uber and Lyft make it all different. People in groups in cities change slowly or not at all.That is why driving Monday to Friday from nine to five doesn't work all that well. Thinking you want to do that is assuming that business wants to be there when you want it to be there and that is a fundamental error. You must adapt to be available for business for when you are needed.Read less..."
Is driving from 9-5 a pipedream for an Uber driver?,AsStibelDude,5856,Isdrivingfro,"Here's an advice.  To be a good rideshare driver, you have to be mindful of the demand of people's travel. At first, you have to do this consciously.  Check your local Amtrak schedules, look up local events, when and which restaurants are busy.  You have to do this while also gauging the *supply*, ie other drivers.The good news is that you will quickly learn and go into a routine.  You will just naturally know, and it becomes a part of your shift.Further advice: here are the hot times, at least wher eI am, and usually in urban areas:6:00AM to 10:00 - People going to airports or for work.12:00PM to 1:30PM - People going to lunch4:00PM to 7:00PM - People going home and to dinnesr, etc.10:00PM to 2:30PM - People going home from bars (especially weekends - infinite demand)Plus any other times when there are local eventsKeep track of your hot and popular times!Good luck!"
Is driving from 9-5 a pipedream for an Uber driver?,LCarpenter,5852,Isdrivingfro,"Like others have said, finding a lucrative time driving rideshares takes an art form. You have to continue tweaking the hours you work, look up local events, and look and plan for anything that may spike the demand in your favor.Most drivers do learn that you can make 2x 3x money during certain hours, so they focus on those. This is usually early morning (before traffic increases efficiency), Mondays/Fridays when transportation hubs are busy, and on weekends, when people are out.It really is difficult to do regular business hours."
Is driving from 9-5 a pipedream for an Uber driver?,joeyj,5900,Isdrivingfro,"As an Uber driver you are kind of running your own little business. If you want to succeed in business, you gotta use your head. When are you going to get the most rides? It might vary in your area. But you gotta figure that out on your own. Go ahead and try the 9-5 thing for a little while. Then try working evenings and late night. See which earns you more money. Drive drunks around for a while, see how they tip.Do your own market research."
Is driving from 9-5 a pipedream for an Uber driver?,SteffGart24,5864,Isdrivingfro,"I found this post, and i am a new driver, and I've been trying the 8 to 4 thing.  I made literally $90 in four days of ""working.""  It's been demoralizing.Uber is so misleading.  It's incredible.  I do understant that there are drivers out there making a lot of money, but they probably work crazy hours or work the odd hours.  Uber offers money AND flexibility, but it sounds like you can only have one."
Is driving from 9-5 a pipedream for an Uber driver?,WWBlueStuff,5865,5864,"Yes, Uber is a liar.but really 8 to 4 isn't efficient.  If you are going to drive 8 hours, can you divide it up.Try working for 4 hours - half what you do, but do it between 8 and 10.  then from 4 to 6.

It isn't constantly a busy job during the day. We get downtime between the fares, and if you took any 8 hour period from 9 to 5, you would definitely have a few hours just waiting.So, you are basically expected to work more than 8 hours just sitting around."

"Philly Uber Riders, look for Driver Ed and Carpool Karaoke",momof4,PhillyUberRi,0,Has anyone ever had ride from Driver Ed in Philadelphia? A young guy drives for Uber in Philadelphia he plays an instrumental version of some well known songs. Catch is he provides no words. Passengers sing along and if they dont know the words they are encouraged to make them up. With their permission he post the video.  Good Day Philadelphia tv show hosts took a ride with him and tried to sing a few songs. It's a good thing they dont need to sing for a living lol. Some riders are drunk some are not but they all look like they are having some fun. If your in Philly look for Driver Ed if you want to be discovered or at very least have a good time on your Uber trip. He has a you tube channel called Driver Ed. Just thought I would share.

And thanks for sharing momof4 ! haha i don't MAKE anyone do it... more often than not passengers are not into it. But one of my favorite parts about uber is how it connects me with so many different people from so many different walks of life, and i think music does the same thing. I'm still getting a handle on what works and what doesnt work with these videos, but I like the idea of showing all these different people connecting over the same song - making the same mistakes - singing the same terrible notes lol .

Should it be legal to own your own self-driving car?,chawes,1576,1572,"They're not saying no one else can use the road. AVs don't require any special infrastructure, that's not the issue here."
Should it be legal to own your own self-driving car?,MelissaMyers,1577,1576,"You are right.  I read it wrong. We can still drive our own cars and buses and trucks can still use the road.With that said, this makes sense even less.  So they want to ban all ""personally owned self-driving cars""?  Not sure what personally owned or business owned have anything to do with it."
Should it be legal to own your own self-driving car?,StuffinMuffin,1580,1577,"Wait, wait.  Melissa is right.  Uber's proposed ""principle"" does ban all vehicles that are not part of the ""automated shared fleets.""  So human-operated delivery trucks, taxis, private or personally owned vehicles will all be banned.   and no you can't drive your own cars either.""Uber, Lyft, ZipCar and others propose outlawing personally owned self-driving cars in central cities, leaving the entire urban core market for automated road vehicles in the hands of corporate fleet owners"""
Should it be legal to own your own self-driving car?,chawes,1623,1580,"I'm not seeing that. This is the stated principle in question:10. WE SUPPORT THAT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES (AVS) IN DENSE URBAN AREAS SHOULD BE OPERATED ONLY IN SHARED FLEETS.Due to the transformational potential of autonomous vehicle technology, it is critical that all AVs are part of shared fleets, well-regulated, and zero emission. Shared fleets can provide more affordable access to all, maximize public safety and emissions benefits, ensure that maintenance and software upgrades are managed by professionals, and actualize the promise of reductions in vehicles, parking, and congestion, in line with broader policy trends to reduce the use of personal cars in dense urban areas."
Should it be legal to own your own self-driving car?,TonyAlmeida,1578,1577,"Actually, you are still right.  Uber is indeed trying to keep certain demographic and cars off the roads, i.e. their turf.Basically, they wan to keep their competition of rideshare AVs off of the road.  This is weird though.  Doesn't this hurt their original goal to have everyone be driving in their spare time?  This move will just make them be the next taxi company."
Should it be legal to own your own self-driving car?,DonutDrivers,1562,1561,"Agreed. UberSubway, baby."
Should it be legal to own your own self-driving car?,tabby,1563,Shoulditbele,So Uber's trying to become a taxi company now huh. Maybe the local governments should give out medallions for the right to operate an AV.
Should it be legal to own your own self-driving car?,SmittenKitten,1579,1563,"Sounds like it.  They want these cars to be approved and licenses for being the ""commercially owned self-driving cars.""  and on top of that, they want to promise reductions in vehicles, parking, and congestion....  that's the medallion system!"

Dang that automotive engineer that designed those seat belts so they won’t lay down flat and poke you in the lower ribs and stomach. Tip take a thick fluffy towel. Roll it up and drape it around your neck for a comfortable car pillow.They didn’t tell me I would depreciate my car 150,000 miles worth. But I got 54.5 cents per mile Safe Harbor Rate from the IRS as a tax deduction. Of course you can only claim as much percentage wise as the actual business use of the vehicle. Keeping your automotives clean and up to snuff ain’t cheap. But clean or as good it might run, you can’t get back those miles.They didn’t tell me how truly ugly the face of the public is. Riders make accusations to scam free ridership. Riders try to game the app to cheat you out of your fair pay. Riders hate on you cause you the last person on earth they saw. Riders can snap. Friendly one moment, seething the next.  Crime, drugs, violations of humanity, all pass through these portals.They didn’t tell me about the long hours (the $25 days) it would take for me to “figure it out”.

Had a nice conversation on our ride. We get to his house and I get out to open back up to get his luggage out. He says, ""I know your not suppose to tip but I really want you to have this"" and hands me 10.00. I was shocked, had he not taken an Uber in 2yrs? I said thank you and we are able to accept tips now. At this time the 8yr old comes over and hands me 3.00 and says, ""I want you to have this"". I look at grandpop to help me. I didnt want to take the kids money. Grandpop asked him ""are you sure"" the kid replied, ""yes I want to give it to her"". I was uncomfortable with that but you dont want to hurt the kids feelings. I was speechless what do you say (as most of you know I am never speechless. I always have something very long to say:)? It was his idea and grandpop double checked with him. Still its a  8 yr old. Talk about awkward. I thanked him but just wanted to get out of there. So damn awkward!!! Child is being raised properly though. Sad that an 8 yr old knows more than most adults. More generous than most adults. He was a sweet kid. Although I think he may have ate 1/2 the candy in the backseat. Grandpop was upfront with me so he had free rein.  I swore I had a decent amount of starburst, mints, and whatever else was mixed in. Although my kids may have gotten into it before I left."

Can you imagine those people being fired simply because someone was in a pissy mood or just felt like they wanted something for free so they made up some BS story? Your job would be more annoying more stressful and just an awful place to be. Ok got off the tipping part sorry. I did order about 8 Ubers for my daughter in law and 1 for my daughter on my account. I just want to mention I threatened them with bodily harm if they got less than 5 stars on my rider account. When the ride is over those 5 stars pop up and ask rider to rate driver. As soon as you rate the tipping option pops up. Not only does it pop up nice & big but in bright royal blue next to the list of trips the rider has taken is the option to tip for 1 MONTH after the ride. There is also an option to tip again. I have tried it up to 3X. All 3X driver received that tip. Sorry but didnt feel the need to put any more money out:) Driver probably thought I was crazy but didnt mind getting 3 tips. With that being said there may be 10% of riders who still think there is no need to tip. The rest either tip, feel the driver dont deserve it, dont tip anyine at all no matter what, visiting from another country, or are just cheap. Uber makes it plain as day for 1 month to be able to tip driver. Dont let riders make you think otherwise. I think my grandpop probably wasnt a frequent Uber rider. Just my opinion.

I used to get more cash tips but seens like most people are tipping in the app. I have no complaints about that but me personally I tip cash. If I order dinner & use my card  I try to always make sure I have cash. In a resturant if I use my card I try to always bring cash. Why let Uncle Sam take your $ or have the waiter/delivery person lose money to taxes. Government gets enough of our hard earned $.

First, the drivers' complete and slavish reliance on nav systems rather than either listening to passengers or actually knowing the city. Second, the weird breakdown of the personal/professional line between passenger and driver. In my day, someone sitting up front was a breach of protocal unless there was no more room in the back; in the rideshare experience there's an illusion of familiarity which I find profoundly disconcerting. As a bicyclist, the brazen and careless way ridesharists use bike lanes for drop-offs is a constant source of frustration. But in the very near future, rideshare will be the only game in town. So, what is to be done?I have no idea what I will do as a passenger once taxis are no longer an option, but Idohave a few suggestions for drivers remaining in the business. If I could stomach sitting behind the wheel more than a couple hours a month, here's what I'd do:1.) Learn the city you work in.2.) Listen to your customers rather than blindly following a machine's directions.3.) Cultivate your own clientele. None of these companies are your employers. You're running your own business and can do a better job if you're not hampered by middlemen.4.) Don't use dedicated bike lanes as if they're your curb to idle in for minutes at a time. It's elementary to demonstrate some minimal human decency in sharing the roadway.5.) Treat the job as a job rather than some ""fun"" side gig to earn a few extra bucks.

Many groans were heard at the gate, but eventually, we all came to accept our fate.  ...and when you accept your fate, you stop stressing. There were a group of us (maybe 6?) who startd to play Uno card game (none of us knew each other before BTW). People from all backgrounds. It was the most fun flight delay I've ever experienced. Maybe ever at an airport.  We were all griping while laughing about sleeping on terminals chairs, making temporary tents between the vending machines, etc.In any case, the girl next to me, Sandy, beautiful black girl who was a self-claimed backpacker, mentioned even if she got to Logan at this point, there won't be any trains or buses she can take so she's stranded anyways. Then the guy to my right, Tom, a white base player from some mediocre band, said something similar.  (I am Asian btw.) We were all ready to spend the night there, maybe play games all the way through.That's when we realized we should just take an UberX!Some experienced travelers (especially drivers who are on this forum) may not think this is that crazy, but to us, it was the wildest idea. Abandoning a ticket mid-trip felt weird. Taking an Uber for 2 hours, which we didn't know we could do.  My car was still at Logan...In any case, this driver, whose name I cannot remember, shows up, looking exactly like Shaggy from Scooby-doo. (No, it wasn't a van. I think it was a red Carolla.) and he graciously accepts our trip to Boston.See, It was really the weirdest but a wonderful and memorable ride. Four people from completely different backgrounds and ethinicity, going on a road trip, in middle of a night, with Shaggy driving the car. At one point, Tom pulls out his base guitar and starts playing Sublime songs. We stopped by at I-90 rest area for pee and snack breaks. We all shared a few chill hits together, and we eventually made it back to Logan.I still sometimes wonder if it really happened.  I ended up driving both Sandy and Tom home, and I didn't get home until past 3:00. The craziest thing? We never got our full names and did not exchange information. Shaggy?  Took off and never heard from him again. Perhaps that's one of the reasons it feels so surreal.In any case, it was one of those stories I will never forget and restores all kinds of faith in the world.Read less..."

I am moving off the beaten path with a gripe about Hewlett Packard!!,fpressly,Iammovingoff,0,"I have owned Hewlett Packard printers for most of my adult life. Sure I have tried others, but seem to find my way back to HP. Their drivers and hardware just work. Sometimes you get lemons; but, the modern day HP with Windows 10 is fairly stable and reliable. The only gripe I have (well maybe I should say the first part of a three point gripe) is how expensive the ink cartridges are. Sure the printers are dirt cheap and they make their money on the ink. I get that part. What I don't like is the hardcore sales pitch they constantly barrage you with coupled with this ""expiration date"" nonsense. And I say nonsense because unless the cartridge has been opened and the ink evaporated the cartridge should be good forever. It is a sealed container and the ink does not leave the cartridge by osmosis. Many years ago when HP started the business with ""expiring"" cartridges it was a means to manage service contracts and keep opened cartridges fresh. The expiration date applied to open cartridges in machines, not sealed cartridges on the shelf. Now years later people have forgotten their original intent and think the expiration date on a cartridge makes it useless. Let me pose a question. All the various printer manufacturers have cartridges that operate on the same basic technology. The inks are almost identical in makeup and the cartridges, although shaped different; essentially work the same way. Why is it then that none of the other cartridges have expiration dates? Hmmm have you ever asked yourself that? Because those other companies just don't know what they are doing? Yeah okay. HP is the only smart guy. Well if you believe their propaganda and throw out those ""expired"" cartridges then I guess they are the smart guy. Much to the detriment of the consumer."

I am moving off the beaten path with a gripe about Hewlett Packard!!,fpressly,10286,10285,I don't know about meds. I imagine they can get stale and lose their potency over time.

If there is a delay longer than 2 minutes from the time the car has arrived and to the time you start your trip, there will be a fee:A per-minute Wait Time fee will begin 2 minutes after your driver arrives at your location. We'll notify you that the charge has started, and it will continue until you enter your vehicle and the driver begins the trip.The time starts to tick when the Uber's Driver App determines the driver has arrived at your location.  It continues to tick until the driver clicks on ""Start Trip.""It's good to remember that the driver does NOT need to indicate they have arrived.

So they get the benefit of no wait time when that happens.My recommendation to all passengers is to be outside when your driver arrives this is a positive thing not only to minimize your wait time cost, busy streets plus no where to park for your driver."

I texted my rider that I was at the light, and got to their pick-up spot forthwith but, it felt like 5 minutes (even though it was probably closer to three minutes!) I am sorry about this but I don’t know what to do about it! Additionally, many times I see that my app has told customers that I will arrive at a location in 7 or 8 minutes and I make it there much faster. Thusly, wait time kicks in while I wait because the client did not anticipate this.  I am sorry again but I don’t know how to stop either one.

They start charging people for wait time after 2 minute when the driver arrives at the pick up location vicinity. Now some times this can cause a bit of problems if the app has recognized the driver is close enough with in a certain amount of feet of the pick up and it starts the count down. If the driver cant find the pick up location or has to circle the block for what ever reason then by the time they get back to the customer it's already counting down but there are uncontrollable circumstances  which could cause this that's not the driver's fault like a busy street where you cant sit and wait for the customer who isnt out and ready to get in. Remember that your assumption maybe one sided and you dont have all the information. The wait time is necessary as a taxi driver there were many cases where we waited more then 20 minutes for people to show up if they did at all. We're out there to make a living and cant wait forever on a bunch of fares, there's not enough time throughout the day for that. We often make 7 or 8 dollars on a single fair when prices are normal and we get even less for Uber Eats calls because of the flat rating method they charge customers. I once did a ride for 16 dollars. The fare after that was a delivery 1 km more then the ride and got 10 for it. I'll only do deliveries now when there's nothing else going on.Read less..."
My Uber driver charged me a wait time... Wait for what?,AsStibelDude,7850,MyUberdriver,"I spoke to a woman rider about this once.  She was confused about what the wait time was. She was telling me about her past rides, and how she was charged for both duration and wait time.That's when I realized that she kept thinking ""wait time"" was the same as the ""wait time"" fromt the taxi days.  That's the term used to describe how long the trip is for traditional taxis!"
My Uber driver charged me a wait time... Wait for what?,jbauer,7852,7850,"Actually ""wait time"" on a taxi isn't the duration of the ride.  It's the time the taxi *waits* in traffic, red lights, and stop signs.Their taximeters are more sophisticated than how Uber tracks the rides per GPS. They are aware of the vehicle's speed, so this ""wait time"" does not kick in unless the car is at a stop or moving very slowly, say less than 5mph.So, taxis only charge you either for the per distance fee OR the wait time fee. Never both at the same time.  At least that's the case with most markets."

So uber goes onto the app, changes the method of payment to a card we had never used on Uber, did not pre-auth but did debit the amount. Backdated the transaction to the day of the real transaction and never told us. This is against the law. So I have recently gone through and looked at 21 rides out of 800 rides since starting this journey. 2 were the correct fare, only 2. The shorter rides were all wrong. Here is the formula and how it breaks down...Base Fare = $.406.43 miles x $.95 = $6.10time = 12.34 minutes x $.09= $1.11BOOKING FEE = $2.25i CAN GUARANTEE THE AMOUNT ON RECEIPT YOU RECEIVE AND THE AMONT ON THE APP DO NOT MATCH EVERYTIMERead less..."

Many times I arrive at a location and the rider is not there. The Uber app says the rider has been notified but nearing the 2 minute mark I call the rider to make sure he/she is aware of my arrival. In many cases the Uber app tells the rider that the car will arrive in 10 minutes and within 2 minutes I arrive. That is the apps fault, not the driver's."

Lyft keeps cancelling trips in Galveston,jimdouglas,Lyftkeepscan,0,I’ve lost trust for Lyft. I recently booked a ride from a hotel near the cruise port to the terminal. My ride and even those of other parties reserved the night before kept getting cancelled over snd over. The app would show the driver close then the driver would cancel. The feeling was they wanted more expensive airport trips. We eventually got rides 3 hours after the promised time. Is there any way to avoid this in the future other than taking a city bus to be safe?

Do they charge differently by the clean up required?Conflict Resolution?The photos are not just for Uber to issue a payment but also to settle conflicts with the passenger.  If a passenger disputes the charge later, Uber will review the photo to determine if an appropriate amount was charged.  Uber may even send over the ""proof"" to the customer.Driver Scams?As a rider, you may want to fully understand the fees, when they are assessed and challenge them when necessary.  There have been reports of driver scams, where these cleaning fees are requested even though there hasn't been much damage.  There has even be reports where the driver would falsify the damages (fake puke anyone?) or even use past photos or photos found on the Internet!!ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated May 11, 2018"

"Can I drive a pickup truck for Uber? I do have an extended cab, i.e. backseats.",reliablerider,19962,CanIdriveapi,"Pickup trucks are allowed on the UBER platform so long as they are a 4-door vehicle with independently opening passenger doors. They should also have enough room and seats to transport at least four passengers. Pickup trucks with rear-hinged doors,hat are dependent on another door being open, are not acceptable. A crew cab truck, with four full-sized doors and two rows of seats, would be acceptable."
"Can I drive a pickup truck for Uber? I do have an extended cab, i.e. backseats.",RacRay79,6336,CanIdriveapi,"Remember the single biggest expense of a Uber or Lyft driver is the gasoline.

"Can I drive a pickup truck for Uber? I do have an extended cab, i.e. backseats.",ryanLarson,6340,6336,"yes, do the math.  F150 at best gets 20mpg in a city driving.  50,000 miles a year.  That's 50,000 / 20 = 2500 gallons, which at $3.00 is$7500.Comparatively, a Toyota Prius at 58mpg?  50000 / 58 = 862 gallons, which at $3.00 is$2500.That's a $5000 a year difference."

"Have you seen this? ""Get free rides by puttin yo uber and lyft drivers on blast""",RedANT,5626,Haveyouseent,"The only reason crap like this persist is because rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft *always* believe passengers, and give no credit (or respect) to drivers.  Al a passenger has to do is whine about something and their fare is refunded, no questions asked, and without input, rebuttal, or presentation of evidence by drivers.  I've had claims made against me, and even though I had dashcam evidence proving my innocence, Uber didn't want to hear my side, because it was easier to svoid confrontation, refund monies paid, and penalize me without question.What amazes me most is how these companies think that the riders are the key to their business, when in reality, they benefit much, much more from the efforts of their drivers.A recent article on BusinessInsider claimed that the average amount spent on rideshare in the local market was $55 per month to Uber, and $53 per month to Lyft.  In comparison, THIS WEEK ALONE, with me working just 17 hrs on the Uber platform, Uber made $187 off of my efforts.  Riders aren't the key to profitability, keeping your drivers happy is."

Amazon Drivers Are Hanging Smartphones in Trees to Get More Work,SmittenKitten,AmazonDriver,0,"Awesome. What time to be alive. Cell phones hanging from trees.Someone places several devices in a tree located close to the station where deliveries originate. Drivers in on the plot then sync their own phones with the ones in the tree and wait nearby for an order pickup. The reason for the odd placement, according to experts and people with direct knowledge of Amazon’s operations, is to take advantage of the handsets’ proximity to the station, combined with software that constantly monitors Amazon’s dispatch network, to get a split-second jump on competing drivers.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-01/amazon-drivers-are-hanging-smartphones-in-trees-to-get-more-work"
Amazon Drivers Are Hanging Smartphones in Trees to Get More Work,BarryWilson,18545,AmazonDriver,"This must something done in the US.  In Canada based on my experience, Amazon contracts Canada post or delivery service to bring packages to customers.    having the first independent driver to deliver packages is another reason why Amazon is a horrible company.  I use it as they have things that are not available in any local stores.  But use it far less than I used to. But I agree I am an enabler to an awful company."
Amazon Drivers Are Hanging Smartphones in Trees to Get More Work,LandLoverRover,18904,18545,"Amazon sucks for many reasons but not this particular case. Remember, they are looking up where the closest drivers are to the distribution centers so they can give them work.These drivers are cheating the system and screwing other drivers who have returned from their previous pickup and are standing by for another delivery. They are also screwing people who are waiting for their deliveries because it'll take them much longer to get them.I assume Amazon is smart enough to figure these people out though.

Looking for Feedback,joseph123,LookingforFe,0,"Hey All,Looking for some honest feedback from rideshare drivers. We make in-car vending machines - our vending machines are completely self-service so you don't have to hand products to passengers. Passengers scan a QR code, select the items they want in our app, the sections with the items open up and the customer is charged for products the select. We were wondering which business model will appeal to rideshare drivers and will appreciate your feedback. We also understand that not all Uber/Lyft drivers like to sell products in their car and that is totally fine - we are seeking feedback from those that are interested in making extra income while driving. You load the vending machine with products and continue with driving.Questions:1. Would you prefer to buy (or finance) the vending machine and sell whatever product you like? In this case, we only take 6% commission for providing you a bunch of tools (payment tools, anti-theft tools, analytics tools, age verification tools, mobile apps/web interfaces for your products and more). You can sell anything as long as you have the appropriate licenses. For example, you can sell CDB products in Colorado, California etc.2. Would you prefer to get the vending machine for free and only sell the products we send you? In this case, we take 80% commission and you get 20% commission.3. Would you prefer to pay a monthly fee for the vending machine ($35) and sell your own items? In this case, we only take 6% commission.Basically, if you get the vending machine for free, you can only sell the products we send you and you get 20% of the revenue. If you buy, finance or pay a monthly fee, we only take 6% commission and you can sell anything you like.Learn more here:http://travtail.com/andhttps://travtail.squarespace.com/stores/p/travdash"
Looking for Feedback,T-RabitDriven,19008,LookingforFe,"There used to be a company called Cargo that did something similar.

They got paid, but it was so loosely managed that no one kept track of inventory and everyone did whatever they wanted to. Basically, the company send them boxes of candies and some money were transacted. I know drivers who were consistently getting free food and eating it all.

Looking for Feedback,DriveMeToTheMoon,19007,LookingforFe,"One thing I can say, and this applies to most drivers, is that none of us want to pay anything up front. Ridesharing driving has a slim margin and we do not like to invest in paying monthly fees or buying a vending machine.In #1, you mention us providing our own products. Many drivers do this already. We are the store, stock person, and a clerk. We offer stuff and riders buy. I am not sure how kosher this is (in terms of law, licenses, tax, etc.), but I know many drivers do this and are very creative with it.That brings me to the point.  Why do we need a vending machine there if we are already selling items from hand-to-hand?  The benefit of a vending machine is I can just leave it and it makes money. We already have a store clerk, so I think it's a hard sell for a driver to ""invest"" or ""pay commissions"" to have a vending machine.I do see the benefit of it being ""self-service"" and more considerate for covid."
Looking for Feedback,MaisieCy89,19010,19007,"I think we all know we can just hand over good. the vending machine provides so much benefits here.For one not all drivers want to be ""selling"" stuff. Have you tried offering something, the passenger says, yes, and you say that it isn't free?  It's super uncomfortable.  The thought crossed my mind to sell items in my car (like water and gum), but it was just hard and awkward. Maybe it's just me, but I prefer a vending machine to be honest. No need to describe anything, no weird criticisms,...  having a legitimate machine gives you the credibility.I like the automatic payment through QR code and such. I don't want to be dealing with money.The covid thing plays into this too, sure. People are already super weird and nervous about taking Ubers. I think the vending machine is exactly what would make this valuable.I have no idea of the finances. I think I like #1 the best. Send us the box for free and we pay commissions. You mention about our buying the box... I don't know. I guess it depends on how much it is."
Looking for Feedback,joseph123,19012,19010,"Thank you very much for your feedback. The machine currently goes for $299 but we can bring the price all the way down to $220.We think the best use of the vending machine is to sell high margin products (chargers, advil, CBD products in markets that allow recreational CDB etc.) instead of low value products like snacks.If we got CBD retail licenses in markets like Colorado and send CBD products to drivers, do you think there will be a reasonable number of drivers interested in getting our vending machine for free and selling products like this in those markets? Or do you think they want to buy/finance the vending machine and sell their own CBD products?

Taxi app won’t be stopped any time soonIt is now over two months since Uber’s license to operate in London came to an end, and yet the taxi company is still running as normal in the UK’s capital. Uber was stripped of its operating license on September 30, but they were certainly not going to give up without a fight and have continued to operate ever since.CEO of Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, claimed he would make things right after Transport for London accused his company of ‘demonstrating a lack of corporate responsibility.’An appeal process has now begun and Uber’s London drivers can continue to operate whilst it runs its course, which could take a very long time.http://metro.co.uk/2017/12/19/current-situation-uber-london-taxi-app-wont-stopped-time-soon-7171771/"

Is it true that Uber Scheduled Rides are not guaranteed?,"ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLC",ippei1202Ube,Isittruethat,"Correct. They are not guaranteed.That is correct.  The ""Scheduled Rides"" of Uber or Lyft are not guaranteed.  This is due to the on-demand nature of their drivers.  There is no way to be 100% sure whether there will be ample drivers and vehicles for your pick-up location in advance.   This is from Uber's website:Q: Am I guaranteed to get a ride?A: Uber actively monitors availability to ensure that a car will arrive during the period you schedule a ride, but does not guarantee your scheduled ride. In the rare case a car cannot be found, you’ll be notified immediately.This tells us how their scheduling system works.  It basically sets a reminder in their system to automatically ""dispatch"" a car for you 10~30 minutes before a specified time.  The rest is basically the same Uber and Lyft.  It offers the fare to a driver nearby, he or she accepts, and comes to get you.BTW, Lyft has a nice feature where they show you the price in advance as well, and they anticipate the Prime Time (their surge pricing) and lock it for you.  No surprises.ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Dec 31, 2016"
Is it true that Uber Scheduled Rides are not guaranteed?,kstark77,1774,Isittruethat,"Wait, hold on a secnod.  So what happens if there are no rides nearby? I don't like this.  So if I ""schedule"" a ride for an early morning pickup to the airport, no one may show up?  What's the point of this?  I can request my own ride when I wake up."
Is it true that Uber Scheduled Rides are not guaranteed?,finkelmana,10907,1774,"The advantage of scheduling in advance is that a drivers are notified in advance. They can accept the scheduled pickup and you will be notified. The app will then remind them to pick you up. It will also prevent them from taking rides that would make them late. While there is no guarantee your scheduled pickup will be accepted, or even shows up, it offers some level of peace of mind. Yes you can schedule a regular ride, but again there is no guarantee a driver will be available."
Is it true that Uber Scheduled Rides are not guaranteed?,CWalcutt75,11168,10907,"That's true with Lyft where drivers are notified in advance and drivers can ""accept"" those rides in advance, days in advance.  However, they are still not required to make the pickups, so it's still not bulletproof.With Uber, it's just another ride.  I cannot remember if it even tells you that it's a scheduled ride.  The ""scheduling"" is just way to schedule a dispatch request at the date and time specified by the rider.  If no drivers, no drivers."
Is it true that Uber Scheduled Rides are not guaranteed?,LG-PA,11181,11168,"On Uber when a prescheduled ride is sent to driver, they add a banner (Scheduled ride), but otherwise it is just a regular ride.On lyft drivers can add the prescheduled rides to theur que, so if a ride is a lucrative one drivers will grab them and will most likley be ready to perform it once it is pushed our way"

Is it true that Uber Scheduled Rides are not guaranteed?,finkelmana,10909,1778,"If you accept a scheduled request, you will most definitely be notified.

That happened to me ALL THE TIME when i booked airport travels -around the world- via Uber in 2016-2017.* Then I switched to Lyft and never once had that headache.* Note: I am now an Uber driver for fun and to become in the top tier of professionals in my area. I have a star rating of 4.95 and I average about $20/hour in Uber X in a city that only earns about $8 on average. I only do it for 10-20 hours a week. But on weekends, I religiously do airport destinations via Scheduled Lyfts, and it is a much better experience for everyone.

No idea how long it's been there but it makes sense.  I guess this settles the debate on what drivers want to have.I also noticed that it's DEFAULTED to be on.  So I guess Uber is cutting off the 4.69> drivers moving forward. Silent killer for some.actually, is it 4.7 for everyone?  I wonder if this is different depending on where you are from.This should also be more obvious. I can think of times where I wouldn't have minded lifting this when I couldn't find drivers."
So that's the threshold: 4.7 Ratings Filter,GundamX10,19635,Sothat'sthet,Mine says 4.7 as well.They make the setting pretty obvious.  I never had to turn it off.  4.7 makes sense though. I've never had any driver that low.
Flagged as a Covid rider?,grace15,FlaggedasaCo,0,"I was informed I was flagged as a ""Covid"" rider and I don't know what that means. I've always worn a mask and have never done anything unsafe. Can someone tell me exactly what this means?"
Flagged as a Covid rider?,SmittenKitten,18767,FlaggedasaCo,"It must be this:Uber, Lyft drivers and riders exposed to coronavirus may be blocked from using the serviceshttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-uber-lyft-drivers-riders-could-have-accounts-suspended/#appThe policy also applies to those who may have been exposed to Covid. When they’re notified of a positive case, they look at the history and identify who else may have been exposed."
Flagged as a Covid rider?,grace15,18768,18767,Thank you for the link. This was helpful but what I don't understand is how I got flagged. I'm not aware that I've ever been exposed to Covid. If Uber has somehow contact-traced me to some sort of high risk event I would think they would notify me?
Flagged as a Covid rider?,SmittenKitten,18771,18768,"A scenario I heard goes as follows. It’s a part of contact tracing:- Uber is notified of a positive case from one of their drivers- They pull up the list of rides that driver has given  They probably use a date range that makes sense to the timing- They mark those riders as “exposed” to notify future drivers- They leave the label on until certain time has passed.I don’t think they can lightly share the details (i.e. which ride), because they maybe exposing drivers’ private medical information."
Flagged as a Covid rider?,grace15,18775,18771,"Thank you. That's helpful and all makes sense except for the part where I wasn't informed I was exposed. That seems like something I should know, yes?"
Flagged as a Covid rider?,SmittenKitten,18816,18775,Absolutely yes.
Flagged as a Covid rider?,RelaxedRecliner,18787,18767,Guilty before proven guilty. Suspected exposure gets you potentially suspended?
Flagged as a Covid rider?,ErasDrivingCo,18779,18767,I wonder how many degrees of exposure they will apply this to
Flagged as a Covid rider?,BrianTheScrewDriver,18789,18779,"Hopefully, and I assume, one.   Considering how many contacts drivers have, two or more degrees can be significant."
Flagged as a Covid rider?,LockieTavish,18793,18789,"Well, not really. So the first degree is the driver (with Covid-19) to the riders.  The second degree would be the riders to the drivers.  This second hop may not be that much. I mean, how many rides do each person get in a few days?Gosh, that'd suck for a driver that gets dinged on that second degree. Drive a passenger with no symptoms and no virus, and you still get suspended or labeled?"
Flagged as a Covid rider?,actingfool,18783,FlaggedasaCo,"Strange, according to this article you would probably be flagged because you didn't wear a mask but if you have always worn a mask then I don't know why a driver would flag you?!https://www.uber.com/en-CA/blog/your-safety-during-the-new-normal/Did you have any drivers cancel on your recently? Maybe some driver just wanted to cancel the ride and put ""unsafe covid"" as the reason?😕"
Flagged as a Covid rider?,PaulScottZ,18781,FlaggedasaCo,I heard from a driver that the flag will be cleared after 14 days from the potential exposure. No idea if this is true or if this driver was a know-it-all.
Flagged as a Covid rider?,grace15,18782,18781,"Thank you for your response. In the meantime I'm sitting at home not going to work while waiting for an answer from Uber support as to exactly what happened. I work with extremely vulnerable populations and if I've been exposed, it is critical that I know what happened. I don't want to make too many assumptions before I get an answer from Uber but if I was contact traced, I feel like it would be Uber's responsibility to notify me officially. If not, what's the point of contact tracing in the first place?"
Flagged as a Covid rider?,PaulScottZ,18790,18782,"I feel you, but the contact tracing is already working as the subsequent drivers are notified of your exposure, right. I suppose they did skip you though. You should know for the people you are in contact with. (family and friends)I don't know if Uber has the legal responsibility to notify you."
Flagged as a Covid rider?,grace15,18791,18790,"I don't pretend to know the law here. But I feel strongly that they had the ethical obligation to notify me. I don't care which driver it was but just a notification that I was potentially exposed would (and has now) dramatically impacted my behavior. As I said before, I am in daily contact with highly vulnerable populations who are immunocompromised. This goes beyond just family and friends. Also, I don't understand why they won't simply answer the question of what that flag even means. I've asked 3 times now and gotten silence in return. So, I went and got a test today out of an abundance of caution and I'm self-isolating while I wait for results. This may seem overkill but in the absense of any answer from Uber it seemed the responsible thing to to."
Flagged as a Covid rider?,BrianTheScrewDriver,18764,FlaggedasaCo,"What does that mean?  Are you now not able to request rides? Or is it that the drivers get informed?We are all already mandated to wear masks, so I’m curious what restrictions come with the scarlet letter."
Flagged as a Covid rider?,grace15,18765,18764,"I have no idea, which is why I'm posting. I was just told this last night. The driver picked me up and he told me I was flagged but he didn't seem to know what it meant either."
Flagged as a Covid rider?,BrianTheScrewDriver,18766,18765,So the driver still picked you up? That’s strange.At least you had a cool river. I guess it prepares the driver.I feel like the passenger should also be notified of their drivers’ conditions.
Flagged as a Covid rider?,AliCommons,18772,18764,"This is all a big witch hunt now.Soon, people who gave rides to Covid positive passengers to have a label, “exposed to Covid.” then on and on.

Does it make sense to buy a (used) car for Uber?,fpressly,Doesitmakese,0,"That is the ONLY thing that makes sense. A new car would be ruined by the mileage you run up on it. Plus a new car is probably financed and would require the most expensive full coverage insurance. Ideally (if you live in the United States) find a three year old car that has come off a lease. A 3 year old car hits it’s sweet spot as to devaluation after a three year lease. If you can find one with high miles that can be bought at a steep discount even better. A three yr. old car will have 45,000 miles on it. Today’s cars go 300,000 easy if you take care of them. So you can drive this one into the ground as the mileage is out of kilter to begin with. If you can buy it outright, without financing, even better.  You need a used car that is comfortable, has large trunk space and generous seating for three in the back. And been taken care of. A Nissan Maxima, a Toyota Corolla, Honda Accord there are a few cars that have history of lonnnnngevity without a lot of upkeep and maintenance."
Does it make sense to buy a (used) car for Uber?,BrianTheScrewDriver,9748,Doesitmakese,"Absolutely.  Driving Uber is a constant fight against expenses and car depreciation. Less your car is worth, less depreciation you incur. Buy or own the oldest car Uber allows in your market and for service type."
Does it make sense to buy a (used) car for Uber?,DriveMeToTheMoon,9823,Doesitmakese,"Well, yes, you should buy a car for Uber driving. You should buy a separate and dedicated car if you are going to do this fulltime.The key factor is whether this is fulltime or not.  If it's a part time, by all means, make some extra cash utilizing the car you already own.

Someone do the math.After more than a thousand rides, I am now convinced that Uber is meant and designed for people who already own a car and taking on this job as a side gig.

Execute it smartly and with determination.As soon as the situation begins and a threatening weapon is produced or using a tone of voice to threaten sets the plan into action. The idea is to pull over and immediately remove your self from the vehicle. Grab your cell phone and as soon you hit Park you should be out the door. Use a little cunning in letting him know what you are doing so he doesn’t over react. Say something like “Let me pull over so we can talk about it.” “We don’t need to kill ourselves do we?” Be agreeable as though you are going along. Grab your phone and get out of that car. Do Not Pass Go. Do not collect $200. Immediately call 911 and let them sort it out.This plan is more effective than the whole first paragraph in assuring you won’t get hurt. That car is not your castle so don’t try to defend it. Don’t even try it. Just Bail! Don’t break real hard or it could throw the attacker over the seat into your lap. Don’t forget your phone as it is your only friend in the world at that moment. But yeah, put as much distance as possible between you and that person. Then from a distance summon the authorities. This tactic works well whether you are male or female, tall or short, large or small, cat or dog.A good reason to put up video cameras inside your ride. Putting up a sign like “Be on your BEST behavior, the world is watching!” to point out the camera could curtail some ideas of a passenger showing out. If not, at least there is a record of it.

I would first slam on the breaks, grab my belongings and BOLT it, while calling emergency 911 on my phone at the same time, heading to a public area where I know there will be other people around.

‘Suicide Surcharge’ or Crucial Fee to Fix the Subway? Taxi Drivers Brace for Battle Over $2.50 Charge,Samarov,‘SuicideSurc,0,Another death-rattle for the cab industry. (via New York Times)
‘Suicide Surcharge’ or Crucial Fee to Fix the Subway? Taxi Drivers Brace for Battle Over $2.50 Charge,lionfool,11389,‘SuicideSurc,"Wait, so taxis are getting a 2.50 fee, and Ubers a 2.75 fee. I mean, it's pretty egalitarian is it not? I don't see how this puts taxis at a disadvantage. I guess they are trying to lobby for being exempt from it."
‘Suicide Surcharge’ or Crucial Fee to Fix the Subway? Taxi Drivers Brace for Battle Over $2.50 Charge,cheesehead,11394,11389,"Yeah I think they're basically saying ""why are you punishing us for a problem that Uber created"". Kind of makes sense..."
‘Suicide Surcharge’ or Crucial Fee to Fix the Subway? Taxi Drivers Brace for Battle Over $2.50 Charge,outlandish,11391,‘SuicideSurc,"Traffic in NYC has definitely gotten considerably worse since Uber took off. No question about it. I have wondered whether a congenstion charge like London has could ever work in a US city, and I think it would be tough. So maybe this is the answer, to just surcharge rideshares instead. Should taxis be included? I don't know. That's a tough one. I think they have reason to complain about it but I doubt it will make any difference."
‘Suicide Surcharge’ or Crucial Fee to Fix the Subway? Taxi Drivers Brace for Battle Over $2.50 Charge,chawes,11393,11391,"I think this is a little different than a congestion charge. I mean, if anything, higher prices will encourage MORE people to drive into the city on their own, not less. I doubt it will keep any Uber drivers or taxis off the road. Overall I doubt it will help with congestion much. Seems like just a way to raise money, which is not necessarily a bad thing if it at least helps make public transportation better..."
‘Suicide Surcharge’ or Crucial Fee to Fix the Subway? Taxi Drivers Brace for Battle Over $2.50 Charge,cheesehead,11390,‘SuicideSurc,"This is a pretty solid argument:In the lawsuit, taxi owners and drivers also claim that they should not be charged a so-called “congestion tax” because their numbers have been capped by city law at 13,587 “to prevent an overabundance of cars and congestion,” even as Uber and other ride-app services had been allowed until recently to expand exponentially.When they put it like that it does seem pretty unfair. That taxi industry is really hamstrung in places like this."
‘Suicide Surcharge’ or Crucial Fee to Fix the Subway? Taxi Drivers Brace for Battle Over $2.50 Charge,chawes,11387,‘SuicideSurc,"The $2.50 fee will raise the minimum taxi fare to $5.80 — which is still lower than an Uber ride. The cost for Uber, which has an $8 base fare in Manhattan, will rise to a minimum of $10.75, including the new $2.75 fee.Amazing that taxis are still cheaper than Uber in NYC. What an unusual place."

Why would a Lyft driver drive away just as we were about to load luggage? And then charge a cancellation fee?,pmlucas,WhywouldaLyf,0,"Scheduled pickup for a trip from home to the airport for one person. At time of booking, Lyft app reports arrival time 0600-0615 the following morning. Early next morning, no notifications of impending arrival as 0600 approaches. No car at 0615. We begin to load luggage in my wife's car for what will now be a rushed drive to airport long term parking. At 0622 Lyft car arrives. I quickly begin moving luggage from our car to the back end of the Lyft car. Driver gets out, walks to back of his car to presumably open trunk and help load luggage. As I turn to retrieve another piece of luggage I said, in an even voice: ""You are late."" Nothing more. He says: ""I am sorry"". As I come back to his car with another piece of luggage, he gets in his car and drives away. To add insult to injury (or rather to add injury to injury) he charges a no show. Why in God's name would he do that? Do not assume that I must have yelled at him. I did not. By the way, my wife got the boarding gate at literally the last minute."

What the heck is Wait & Save? How does it appear for the drivers?,AngieKM169,Whatthehecki,0,"This option started showing up for me late 2020. It may have been there for longer but I never saw it before.  I honestly am not sure what to make of this because I never really know how much I am willing to wait.I mean, has there been some expectation before as to how quickly a driver is supposed to show up?  Some kind of an SLA? I don't remember there being any. 10 minutes?  20 minutes?Is there some kind of threshold as to when something becomes a wait & save?  It feels pretty obscure to me and do drivers get paid less?"

Who calls for a ride like, ""I sorta wanna leave but don't really need to. "" I am sure it exists but how often is that?"
What the heck is Wait & Save? How does it appear for the drivers?,DriveMeToTheMoon,19441,Whatthehecki,This reminds me of Amazon how they have some obscure shipping options.  Like delivery on Amazon days and combine to fewer shipments.

For a start, if someone tried to hail a cab on it's way to us, the driver would invariably take the hailer and leave us high and dry without our knowledge. Complaints got you nowhere.Also, I used to live in the only part of Chicago (Montclare and Galewood) that did not have  a 606xx zip code - it is 60707, shared with Elmwood Park. I'd call for a cab and the dispatcher would tell us (wrongly) we were in the 'burbs with that zip code and he can't send a cab. So then we'd call the suburban cab company which would then tell us that they couldn't do the job if the destination wasn't in the suburbs.

Usually with an irate parent or teen when you tell them you cant take them. Just so frustrating. I dont care to hear ""the last driver did it"". Too bad riders dont realize we dont have to do what  the last driver did. The mentality of people still manages to surprise me. Why? I dont know:) Common sense isnt something many people have. Wonder if more will come out about that night? Too many unanswered questions. People need to start taking responsibility for themselves and stop blaming everyone else. Uber and Lyft need to improve on a few things with the app. Drivers need to be careful as no one is going to help us. Not the rideshare companies or their insurance. We are on our own. I still feel parents are sadly mistaken if they think their daughter would still be alive. They are still in denial and dont know much about mental illness. Unfortunately that is why their daughter is no longer here. If the driver said no to the ride that girl wouldnt of went back into the house, went to bed for the night, never to consider suicide again. She needed help something the parents never considered.

No way in hell would I send my kids in an Uber without an adult.  Kids have their own acct with their parents debit card. Then there is the driver. Some drivers will cancel and not take these kids others will take them. So who is to blame?Parents need to take responsibility for their part. Do not give your kids permission to take U & L. Do not give them access to your rideshare acct or your debit/credit card info. Do not order an Uber or Lyft for them.Drivers do not pick up minors. Too many things can go wrong and eventually will go wrong.Uber and Lyft for not taking action when drivers report the minors trying to take a ride. Not making riders sign up with valid ID. They have been around long enough with many different safety ussues arising over the years. Drivers have given ideas, sent reports, etc... these companies just dont do anything until tragedy strikes. So sad.Uber and Lyft are not totally to blame for this incident. As much as I feel bad for these parents they need to take responsibility also. It was their child they were responsible for. She could've took a bus, cab, etc... if transportation options failed she probably wouldve figured something else out. If the Uber driver said no I think its safe to say she had a plan B. Regardless we will never know.  I just dont feel Uber is 100% at fault. Parents, Uber, and driver each needs to take some responsibility. The only reason I feel driver was at fault because its kind of hard to mistake a 12 yr old as being 18. Had she been 15, 16,17 maybe. Other drivers tell you all the time not to take minors. Was the $10/$20 (probably less) really worth it?Time to step up Uber and Lyft. Make riders sign up with real legit legal ID. Stop allowing people to use other riders accts. Give drivers access to updated pics of our riders with resl names.Drivers cancel minors and send report to UBER snd Lyft.Parents, stop allowing your kids to use Uber and Lyft. Stop ordering Uber and Lyft for your minor children. You are placing them in danger and screwing the driver. Although if you are sending your 10 yr old with a stranger in a car why would you even care that you are screwing the driver? Why is it that the drivers that cancel on minors care more about your child then you do? SMH makes no damn sense.Parents, if you are wondering on why you should not send your children in an Uber please read post ""Attn Parents, Do You Know Where Your Children Are"" in the forum.Read less..."

Dont really know because I wasnt there and it has never happened to me. Being a parent myself yes I wouldve thought something wasnt right. The last thing I wouldve thought this child was up to was she was headed out to kill herself. I would assume  she was sneaking out to meet a friend. As a human being and a mom yes I wouldve looked into a little more. If the child said ok Ill just go home I wouldve left. Maybe driver has no children, thought she was 15, 16 yrs old. Maybe he was minding his own business like most people do. He was just doing what he was paid to do with the exception of driving a minor. We are not paid to get involved in people's lives or give advice. In most instances people would be pissed if we start getting into their business. Yes she was 12 but lets assume he thought she was 15,16, or 17. None of that would be odd behavior. I am bad at judging peoples ages. Lets say she was dressed a way to make her look older, had make up on, hair done, and driver didnt really look at her when she got in car. There would be no way for him to know what she was planning. I am guilty of just taking a quick glance when rider gets in. I talk to them if they are willing to talk. Some people simply ignore you and dont say a word. Others say hi and thank you and answer ""fine or good"" when you ask how they are. Three words, how would anyone figure out that their rider was suicidal with only 3 words spoken. As far as the actual drive I am watching the road, GPS, and cars around me. I end the trip and say good night. If Uber or Lyft stacked my ride I leave immediately to head to next pick up. Other than the driver picking up a minor they did nothing wrong.Read less..."

Even if driver had dash cam they probably only safe 30 or 60 days and delete it after that. Guess another lesson learned dont get rid of any footage for a year.I've picked up a few 16,17 yr olds before I found out we were not allowed. Hell I made every rookie mistake out there my 1st month. I took a 16 yr old few months back. He was 6'4"", facial hair, headed to Airport at 3am to fly by himself to Cayman Islands for Olympic trials. Mom was at door said bye to him. I assumed he was in college. Had a intelligent adult conversation. When he told me how old he was and I told him he wasnt allowed to take Uber his jaw dropped along with mine. Lol  At that point we were 25 min into a 55 min trip wasnt dumping him on NJ turnpike at 3am. Knew his mom knew about it and no traffic on road at 3am Sunday morning.  I wouldve never thought he was only 16 yrs old if I didnt hear it come out of his mouth. Hell he tipped me 15.00 cash out of his pocket. Said he enjoyed the trip. Parents had money but were teaching him how to be responsible:)  He definately wasnt your typical 16 yr old. I felt bad told him to use tip $ on his trip he replied ""please take it i really want you to have it"".  Kid had more common sense and kindness then most adults out there.:)Kids also buy fake ID the more $ they pay the better the ID is.  Just like the car seats  its our ass on the line if something goes wrong. Uber and Lyft need to start making riders sign up with valid ID's. It's Lyfts and Ubers platform their TOS that they made up they need to enforce it. It shouldnt fall on drivers. Asking for ID = 1 star.  I also hate leaving these kids stuck late at night. Their parents may not care but I have a conscience and I cant just drive away and leave them. Ended up one time waiting 20 min until parent got there. I glance back when my passenger gets in smile, turn back around then ask how are you and so on. I dont stare at them and try to figure out there age. Like I said I've taken minors a few times not knowing in my rookie days. Now I  turn them down. Sixteen yrs old and up should be able to ride. They can have a job, fly, ride a bus, train, and cab. I have fingerprinted FBI check and child abuse clearance but Uber & Lyft's insurance wont cover us. Luckily I dont get teens very often. Never had anyone younger than 16 either request a ride.Maybe if they would charge these kids or the parents who order for them 10.00 cancel fee 20.00 the 2nd time and so on bet they would stop then. Its a win win for Uber and Lyft we take them get them there safely U and L get their 35%/45%. We get in an accident they deactivate us & insurance dont pay. You know this will end up all falling on that driver.  At the very least he will need a lawyer and get deactivated.  I hate to say this because nobody deserves to have their child die but parents need to accept most of the responsibility on this one. Uber could easily make it very difficult for this to even be an issue. I do have to say driver needs to take some responsibility for not questioning her age. This subject is all over forums, you tube, web sites, FB. Some drivers admit taking kids and just dont care. They will the day they get sued. Twelve is on the young side to think she was 18. Maybe hair, make up, and clothes worn threw driver off. Although I would think you would still notice. Unless driver never even looked back at the girl when she got in. Which is very possible. Usually females are not a threat. Maybe driver didnt speak English so no words were exchanged at all. All i know is Uber and Lyft needs to do something with riders with no car seats, minors, and overall safety for drivers. I dont think the girl would still be alive. I think they are wrong in thinking that. She set out to kill herself that night. She was in a dark place in her mind. She needed professional help. Lets say driver did cancel she wouldve found another way to kill herself. The driver is under no obligation to knock on parents door and say ""your underage daughter is trying to take an Uber"".  They cancel and move on. That driver had no idea what she was up to hell her own parents didnt have a clue.  Hate to say this but either looking for someone to blame (kind of understand why, part of grief process blame) or a payout. The reason I say the payout is because there is many questions that are not answered. The biggest ine being as I mentioned why wait 6 months to notify Uber and the press? Just like the young lady that got killed few months back. Few questions there also that never were answered or addressed. Thanks for commenting RedAnt. Enjoy reading your comments. Always to the point and spot on:)  Still kind of wondering about that post about the Uber driver who dropped the 50 something ladies. Unanswered questions there also maybe some of the stiry missing:) who knows. LolHow was your trip?Read less..."

If so, why?- Does the photo match up with any other photos submitted by other passengers?- Does the photo match up with the car that the driver drives?Why so secretive about this process?Well, it's because none of these things will *prove* that the photo is not authentic or that the incident didn't happen.  If the file was modified or if the pic was taken by a different camera than the smartphone the driver conveniently had in his hand, you would start to doubt the authenticity.This is why Uber won't tell you exactly why you are being denied the cleaning fees or that you don't have credibility.I hope I have adequatey answers how Uber *must* be fighting back against this cleaning fees fraud.  They do it because they can, and it isn't that hard.Read less..."

I carry my vaccination card with my insurance/registration and voluntarily show each passenger.  Happily I might add.  It's a common curiosity on my part to my passengers.  Plus I shower, wash my hair brush my teeth and wear clean clothes everyday not only for my own personal hygiene but I'm in a confined space with others of MY OWN choosing.  So wearing a mask inside my own car with no passengers/no pay etc. Is beyond anything I'll ever do.  How about having the uber run a background on YOU the passenger, show a picture to us a driver in the application and where you are going to ""in case of being robbed or murdered"" before we accept your request for a ride? Not to mention you empty out all your contents from your bags/person to make sure you don't have drugs, weapons, or paraphernalia?  I mean since ""we're all in this together""Read less..."

From: Boston - To: Waltham,BeMatt,19880,From:Boston-,I would recommend ordering an Uber for the first few days and once you find a driver you like asking them to pick you up daily! This is how I have always found my regular drivers.
From: Boston - To: Waltham,AsStibelDude,19867,From:Boston-,Maybe best to take the bus from Waltham. The best bet is finding the Express Buses like 505 that takes you directly to downtown with limited stops.

Kid Rideshare,KristenJanetKim,KidRideshare,0,"Hi, I’m new to the forum. One of the reasons I was invited by the CEO is because I drive for 6 apps, 3 of which are for kids. I’m the San Francisco Bay Area and drive for HopSkipDrive, Kango and Zūm. HopSkipDrive is also available in L.A. and Denver, and Zūm in L.A. I’d like to hear from anyone who drives for any of these companies. If there are other kid rideshare drivers out there in other areas, also make yourself known.For those you unfamiliar with kid rideshare, it’s typically for kids 5-17, though there can be younger children or even adults as well. Driver screening is more thorough, including fingerprinting. Drivers must have experience working with children. Some may count parenting. I’m a teacher. Rides are generally scheduled in advance. Single rides can be scheduled, but most rides are recurring (going to and from school M-F is very common). You will always know the destination and pay for the ride before you accept it. You can also choose how far you’re willing to drive. Rates are higher for parents because the companies have insurance that will cover unaccompanied minors. Parents are notified when the driver arrives, they can track their chikd’s Ride on the app and are notified when dropoff is complete. There is someone in the office monitoring all rides and if anything arises, help is just a phone call away."
Kid Rideshare,rebeccalynnlock,19543,KidRideshare,"Hi Kristen, thanks for the post. My company Kidcaboo, including our apps, is a Driving Nanny service for children. We begin service in NJ and in multiple other states beginning this August. Our website itwww.kidcaboo.com. Please let me know if you have questions. Again, thanks for the post and stay well!

Kid Rideshare,AsStibelDude,6636,KidRideshare,"Boston driver here.  We have one company here called Sheprd. I thought about applying, but they seem to be very selective and they provide their fleet of cars (i.e. All Land Rovers.). Doesn't seem much like a rideshare but more of a school bus driving.The diver schedules are henerated on a periodic basis and they are adjusted on a daily basis. It seems like a regular car service.Are other companies like that?  I think Sherprd is the only one in Boston that takes kids. (I think.)"
Kid Rideshare,KristenJanetKim,6638,6636,Kango in the San Francisco Bay Area has both drivers in their own cars and company-provided vans. I drive my own car.
Kid Rideshare,AsStibelDude,6639,6638,"Thanks. Naturally, the conversation moves to the insurance if you are driving your own car.  Are you an independent contractor? And who pays for the liability insurance?  Is it similar to Uber's?Driving kids must require crazy and special insurance policies, I'm thinking. One thing I know not to do is to open myself up for big liability."
Kid Rideshare,KristenJanetKim,6640,6639,The rideshare companies provide the insurance. Drivers just need their personal insurance like Uber and Lyft. I also have a separate rideshare policy. It’s more expensive to ride with the kid rideshare companies due to the insurance that covers unaccompanied minors.
Kid Rideshare,BGraft89,6642,6636,Zemcar is available. I'm pretty sure it started here.It says they pay 1.5x to 2.0x more than Uberhttps://www.zemcar.com/driver
Kid Rideshare,AsStibelDude,6643,6642,That page says they provide insurance but it's only for during rides. So you aren't covered when ou are waiting or on the way to the pickup.That scares me.
Kid Rideshare,BGraft89,6644,6643,"Yeah, but in regards to the kids thing, you just want to make sure you are covered for when you are with the kids, right?Other times, your personal polcy should cover you. (And yes I know there's a gray area when you are on the way to the pickup.)"
Kid Rideshare,KristenJanetKim,6647,6644,"That’s why you get rideshare insurance, to fill in the gray areas."
Kid Rideshare,BGraft89,6651,6647,"Oh, that's what that is?  I thought it was just a way for the insurance companies to barge you more money.I guess it is, because they're supposed to covering me for all legs, at least all legs when I'm not driving customers."
Kid Rideshare,KirstenGH,8316,6636,Isn't Safr from Boston?
Kid Rideshare,WWBlueStuff,6634,KidRideshare,"I do have a lot of questions on these kid rideshares.  I mean lots. The biggest question I have is how much you can make while babysitting kids. I assume there's a lot more trouble, messiness, more time incurred on pickups and drops-offs, etc.  Not sure if it's worth it.I've spoke to a few who tried it and they told me they do pay better, but how much better?"
Kid Rideshare,KristenJanetKim,6635,6634,"Zūm and Kango also offer sitting services. I don’t do that. I only drive. You can choose to drive only locally to keep time on pickups down. I’m willing to drive longer distances for pickups. I average $20 per ride. And most of the business is from 3-5 pm, when it’s ususlly slow with Uber and Lyft. It’s also busy before school, but since I’m a teacher, I don’t do mornings. Kids are much better behaved than many adults! And less messy too.As a woman driver, I need to be concerned with my safety as well. Kid rides allow me to drive mostly during the day. I don’t really like driving late nights. If I do drive late, I do airport pickups."
Kid Rideshare,WWBlueStuff,6646,6635,Those are solid arguments. I particularly like how they provide work during Uber/Lyft's slow periods and how it enables you to drive during the day.
Kid Rideshare,DonutDrivers,6645,KidRideshare,"No money in the world will make me drive other people's bratty kids. It's hard enough with adults, where I'm on a three weekend puke streak. I don't need to add juice spills and Cheerios on the floorYes, bratty. How can they not be taking $25 rides to soccer practices, each way. These aren't the regular kids you see at town pools."
Kid Rideshare,KristenJanetKim,6648,6645,"I’ve only had one problem child. I was given a negative rating, and when they do that, you will be blocked from their account. The kids I’ve had have been very well behaved. I don’t allow food in my car. Many of my kid passengers are actually 17-18 year olds, on an internship with Genesys Works, so they are really like adults. Most of them work at high tech companies in the South Bay, from San Jose to Redwood City, and they have been a pleasure to give rides to."
Kid Rideshare,DonutDrivers,8315,6648,"They should make it so kids can be banned and deactivated.  We all know some kids can be punks and are troublemakers.and yes, drivers should be able to put kids on the blacklist, just as the kids (and their families) can.Actually, since you have experience, here is my question to you:Do you rate the kids too and can you block certain kids from appearing?"
Kid Rideshare,Bigfrank,13855,KidRideshare,LA the lunie toons of America  . if I'm going to drive kids I will get a job as a school bus driver where I get paid an hourly salary plus full benefits and a 401K plan
Kid Rideshare,FannyPack24,7417,KidRideshare,Does anyone know how these companies are doing?  Like profitability?  or are they having issues like all other rideshares?  I suppose many are just trying to get the idea/concept to take off.  Probably all in a investing mode and working at a loss.
Kid Rideshare,KristenJanetKim,7420,7417,"Uber and Lyft are always the ones in the media. The kid rideshare companies are so much smaller and I’ve never seen anything in the media about their profitability, only about their existence. One of the supervisors at Kango told me she used to work for another kid rideshare company that is no longer operating. HopSkipDrive recently expanded to Denver after just being in the S.F. Bay Area and L.A., but that still doesn’t say anything about their profits."
Kid Rideshare,CathleenS.Adkison,6818,KidRideshare,I really wish these were available in Seattle. Uber did it briefly.
Kid Rideshare,CharlieLazie,6891,6818,"Wait, what.  Uber did this?  UberKids?but if it's gone now, I guess it didn't work out.  Probably too complex and too much on liability.Have you tried Pogo?https://ride.guru/content/newsroom/rideshare-services-for-children"
Kid Rideshare,AsStibelDude,6893,6891,Pogo is just a software that you parents can use to organize a bunch of parents to drive.  I don't think they act as a rideshare company.  not ad-hoc.
Kid Rideshare,KirstenGH,6659,KidRideshare,6 apps!!  That's a lot.
Kid Rideshare,wraiththe,11936,6659,"Have to admit, it is a little intimidating… however, it might be fun.  As long as there are good security measures in place... I like the tracking part... I might be willing to give it a go.   However, I do not think there is anything like this in Charlotte, NCIt would seem improbable that you could make much in a day, as I would think there are probably only a narrow field of hours these rides are needed."

(Driving full time),CharlieLazie,8022,Isitpossible,"Well, most sources say that you make $14~22 an hour, and that comes with flexibility and long shifts that have some downtimes.  Of course, you can make a living off of it.  Plenty of people make $20 / hour and have a perfectly fine life!"
Is it possible to support my family driving for Uber or Lyft? (Driving full time),DrevenTremino,7989,Isitpossible,"I would recommend finding some other full time job, one where you are not putting wear and tear on your personal property. Then to supplement drive Uber part time. It will be exhausting but you will notice an increase in your income and the extra cash you can get from driving can just take the edge off when it is time to pay the bills."

Why has the issue of tipping for RideShare become such a fixation and under appreciated topic by the public?,fpressly,Whyhastheiss,0,"What is it in the public's mindset that has set the stage for such a bruhaha over tipping RideShare drivers? I don't read any other subject/topic that has gotten so much time and discussion and with so little result.  What has lowered the status of said drivers to less than maids or car parking attendants (people tip them without a single word of discussion, opposition or question). Not only do people not tip but you would be amazed at the ones who try to game the system for freebies. Many times frivolous complaints are claimed at the expense of innocent drivers. People think they are gaming Uber/Lyft when in reality it most affects the drivers. Uber/Lyft is a heartless app. Certain feedback and complaints initiate game changing results and separate drivers from the platform until human review. Sometimes up to 72 hours. Part of it may be that these people feel like they will never see this person again and therefore have no explanation to give why they didn't tip. Tipping is more an indicator of the tipper as a person than anything. Good people make good decisions. Bad people make excuses.Playing the devil's advocate, I guess the public could see RideShare drivers as wildcat opportunists, working for themselves and making all the money.

It would be a bonus from the rideshare provider's end of the proceeds.$2-$3-$4 that the rideshare kicks back to the driver for services well done at the recommendation of the rider. They could advertise it as ""Now with FREE tipping"".Look if Uber and Lyft didn't make but $2-$3 a ride they would still make billions.

Why has the issue of tipping for RideShare become such a fixation and under appreciated topic by the public?,Wes,10565,Whyhastheiss,"Well, the concept of your suggestion is built upon the assumption that Uber/lyft could ""afford"" to give away a larger percentage of their take.  And when we, as drivers, sometimes see them get more than 50% of the fare, it does seem like they're being pigs.  BUT, keep in mind they're losing BILLIONS of dollars at present - they've never had a profitable year - FAR from it, and they're current pricing scheme where they are clearly taking more than ever is a desperate move to decrease their losses before they go public.My best ""guess"" is that we will eventually see things improve (and rates increase although I feel their share will become much larger than it is today) after they go public.  Other than that, don't expect to see either company offering any additional dollars to their drivers any time soon."
Why has the issue of tipping for RideShare become such a fixation and under appreciated topic by the public?,RedANT,10562,Whyhastheiss,"If Uber and Lyft can convince passengers to tip you $20 more per day, it's an opportunity for them to cut your pay $15 per day (going into their own pockets) and spin it to make it seem like they're doing a favor for drivers.  In reality, all they're doing is getting passengers to subsidize corporate profits.Once upon a time I was concerned about tips.  Now the overwhelming problem isn't tips, but rather changes to pay structures that cut further into our profits.    Making $30 less per day in base earnings is a bigger issue than getting $4 more in tips."
Scheduling in advance for the intellectually disabled,heatherfeather520,Schedulingin,0,"My uncle is intellectually disabled. He struggles with reading and smart phones. We are trying to figure out a way we can set up a ride share for him on the nights he works later than the bus runs. Uber it seems you can set up a ride for someone else, and you can set up a ride in advance, BUT you cannot set up a ride in advance for someone else. I tried searching Lyft, but it seems that is not a guarantee of a ride. HELP! My mom cannot stay up til after 11 two nights a week to set up his Uber.We know about Uber Assist, but he has royally screwed up his smart phone. It is in the process of being fixed. Thanks in advance!!"
Scheduling in advance for the intellectually disabled,DougH,19319,Schedulingin,"Check out gogograndparent. It allows you to use a regular phone to request a ride, and makes it easier to request a ride for someone else. Not exactly sure how it works with scheduling tho."
Scheduling in advance for the intellectually disabled,brownbear,19320,19319,Yeah I was going to suggest gogograndparent too.
Scheduling in advance for the intellectually disabled,VasPar,19348,Schedulingin,This reminds me of the desired feature where you can warn the driver of certain conditions.  There's a way to share certain things but the latest I heard was the ability to hear. being deaf.Not sure if there is a way to do this. Perhaps calling and creating a relationship with a local taxi company?  They still do exist.
Scheduling in advance for the intellectually disabled,brownbear,19315,Schedulingin,Can you just log into his account on your phone and book it in advance that way?
Had to drive my uber drivers car home after getting pulled over.,Kathryn_17x,Hadtodrivemy,0,"I was pulled over during an uber ride in texas and my driver started freaking out, he hadn't had a valid tx license, and the car he was driving wasnt registered to him nor did he have insurance. The cop who pulled us over hugged me and said wr had went to high school together and told the driver hes lucky that he was with me or else his car would be impounded, and asked if i would drive it instead.  It was so strange. I didn't go to high school with the cop, yet he put on such a great show about all of it. I was currently going to court on a pending charge and i wound up getting probation not long after and ironically, my probation officer is the guys sister.  Coincidence or violation of my privacy ? Please give me yalls opinions and thoughts!!!"

Are you saying that your probation officer is the Uber driver's sister? or the cops sister? I don't see why this cop would let the driver off like this.

Had to drive my uber drivers car home after getting pulled over.,LRE,19325,Hadtodrivemy,"Sounds like an interesting situation. I woulda been happy to play along w the cop to help the driver out. Although I’m curious to kno whether the cop was sincere or just puttin on a show so they didn’t need to ticket the driver, impound the car and write a report. I’m generally on the opposite side as the cops, at least until there is a general consensus among them where they recognize that they work for the tax payers and their duty is to uphold the constitution of the United States not be at war against the average citizen or believe it’s their job to “sniff out” crime all while power tripping on their “authority”. As far as the Probation Officer situation, I’m not sure exactly who’s sister they are but if being related helped you out, which I hope it did/does, then I’d say that is good too, even if you feel like your privacy was invaded a bit.I do hope you got your fair for free and are promised a couple free fairs in the future from this driver you saved.Great story anyway, thanks for sharing."

I went where Uber sent me! I sat outside a driveway where I went to waiting time. The phone rang , I picked up, and the client asked me where I was. I informed him that I was waiting on a dead end street in a cul-de-sac for him. He told me that he was at the Sunoco about 50 yards away - (through a backyard)! I told him, “I’m on my way!” When I got there ( about 3 minutes later), I told the client and his boyfriend/girlfriend that if he had put in an address, there wouldn’t have been a problem . The client was very mad! I got them to their destination Lickity - Split! The boyfriend/girlfriend told me everything was alright after I apologized for the misunderstanding.

Of course they are devistated and are only trying to help others. Very understandable. This is where Uber and Lyft should step in to make it clear on procedure. Let people know the driver cant give name first. It is in driver and rider TOS but who reads that:) I know I didnt, big mistake. I made every rookie mistake out there. You live and learn. Thankfully I learned:) I had an issue the other night on Lyft with them adding a rider while I still had a rider. Was totally unaware until that rider called me. I explained i was not driving anymore after I dropped off current rider as I had been on road for awhile. I cancelled now Lyft is trying not to pay me for the rider that I did take. It was a 53 min ride not sure of miles at the moment. Probably a 32.00 trip. I have all the screenshots of the trip and took screenshots at dropoff. I am fine with them not paying me for the 2 min .5 miles  at end of trip (thats when I supposedly cancelled). The rest they better pay me for. Going to  call if that dont work Ill go to hub. I am fairly new on Lyft. So I am not turning app off after I accept ride so they cant add on. Will turn back on after dropoff. When they add rides like that we see no name, no pic, no rider rating. I want no part of picking anyone up until I at the very least see name and rating (pics not always there). They say we can choose to decline but yet they add and we have to cancel. Happy that my post help. Sorry about the length of post but I always have a lot to say. 🙂 Be more than happy to help you if you need it. I met another rideshare driver who dont live far from me here on ride guru. He has given me the confidence to drive where I never of thought I would go. Given me great tips on where to drive. We work together testing new spots and doing research on when and where to drive. During the week we text and he listens to me complain. Lol Prior to meeting him I didnt know anyone in my area that drives. My family gets tired of my stories:).   Sometimes just need to vent or I may want his opinion on a ride. On day he drives I dont feel so alone out there. Lol Sometimes we end up at same spot so we talk til we get a ride. Its a lonely job. Nice to have a ""partner""(sort of) that knows what its like to be an Uber driver. 🙂. Its not so lonely and boring at times.  Happy to help anyway I can.Read less..."

Has Uber and Lyft killed the taxi business?,GeorgeMendes,HasUberandLy,0,"I'm a dispatcher, they haven't killed us but they have surely given us a wound we can't really recover from. Most of our drivers if they're not answering our calls or alerts from their systems about potential jobs we're assuming are doing Uber jobs.Uber, Lyft, and Juno are all apps that show up on their phones during monthly inspections. We also have to make sure they're not using GPS cheaters to fake being somewhere while doing an Uber job.Mostly what keeps us in business is SUV work and specialty vehicles like Mercedes Sprinter Vans and Passenger Vans, we also offer a lot more hands on responsibility than Uber. Our customers like knowing if they have a problem they can speak to someone who will give them an answer then and now. They also get to know and request their drivers and with Uber it's always random, so mostly it's older people who don't trust this new technology enough to let someone random drive them home a way they're unaccustomed to."

Has Uber and Lyft killed the taxi business?,CWalcutt75,13402,13386,"I agree that they fell behind the time with the dispatching technology. However the taxi industry tried but they couldn’t keep up.  Why?Localized regulations, localized taxi companies, localized taxi and medallion ownerships.  There was no centralized organization that could invest, adopt such technology, and implement it everywhere.  Uber has no regulations to deal with (in the beginning) and the world as the targetable audience, they had a huge leg up over localized taxi companies.Speaking of regulations and medallions, the government who enforced those rules on them should have protected them or at the least made a move on Uber at much earlier stages.

Can Uber and Lyft drivers refuse a passenger for any reason?,MolGoldberg,14721,14613,"Right, but being disrespectful, and verbally or physically violent are indeed good reasonable reasons for kicking them out.

Can Uber and Lyft drivers refuse a passenger for any reason?,JBurd,14723,14721,LOL - being completely naked in public is illegal in the USA!  I don't think the driver has to take you anywhere if you are breaking the law!
Can Uber and Lyft drivers refuse a passenger for any reason?,Uberserge,14590,CanUberandLy,"Ultimately, drivers are IC, they can refuse requests,  it’s their private car. But once they are at pickup, there are some guidelines. As per Uber &  Lyft drivers can’t discriminate for gender, race and they must give a ride to pax with support animals. That is regardless of them being allergic to the support animal such as dogs. If the ride has been started and things go sideways, the passenger can leave a comment and the driver could be deactivated. If the ride hasn’t started and the driver cancels and drives away, there isn’t much a pax can do."

Can Uber and Lyft drivers refuse a passenger for any reason?,Uberserge,14748,14744,"You can use my referral link and sign up to drive UBER 😆Seriously, as per ADA, American's with Disabilities Act prohibits all ride for hire vehicles to refuse rides for passengers. A taxi driver can be sued probably since they are governed by regulators.Uber and Lyft constantly send e-mails to drivers not to refuse rides to anyone with a support animal. That supersedes a situation like the driver to be deadly allergic to a dog or a cat. They can easily fix it in the app but they don't, they force drivers with allergies to suffer. Go figure!"

You can only cancel after you accept a request. So study the ping and don’t accept if it’s not what you want.

Driving with an LLC or Corp? How to send your EIN to Uber or Lyft [RidesharingDriver.com],ErasDrivingCo,19168,19163,"You can be operating as a small business and have an LLC and driver for Uber. It's up to them whether to accept that or not, but from my experience (and from what I hear), they are not that selective about it. They basically want that for payment (EIN) and they don't inquire too much about what your LLC is about and what the business is about. I don't think you will have an issue.Technically though, you should probably check with a) your accountant, b) insurance agent, and c) the state as well.  Usually when you register your business with the state, you have to declare what your business is about and what it offers.  If it's significantly different than ""driving people around,"" I think they might have an issue about it.The accountant will give you a financial advice. I don't think they care too much about the type of business.  However, the state and definitely the insurance company will care. (e.g. insurance company needs to know what you are doing in order to assess the risk and provide coverage.)"

I dont know what I made on trip let alone if I got a tip.  App not working as other drivers said. It shows you made 1 trip then few minutes later a red note comes up that there is a problem. The note also states ""dont worry trip info and amounts are safe"". Thats a load off my mind Uber said ""it's safe"" as you all know we can trust Uber.

I got back to WaWa so Mike didnt call the police & report me as a missing person. I stuffed 20.00 in Mike's pocket as a thank for suggesting to guy to let me drive him and having my back during the ride. 35.00 and a pay it forward gesture was good enough for me for 14 min of my time. Sometimes it pays to do a favor and to be nice. Yes, I do know that things could've went wrong in many different ways.  I believe if your doing something nice for the right reasons things usually turn out ok.Wanted to add this.  RIDERS if you order an Uber on a snowy or bad rainy day/night please be a decent human being and tip your driver.

The whole city along with Lower Bucks was surged. Surge was up to 30.00 in some areas. I will drive in snow but never again if traffic is heavy. Uber screwed me on both long pick up fees. One trip took 26 min the other 47 min. I was paid for 2 min for both for long pick up fee 1.97 and 2.57. They pd. me according to what it should've took not what it actually took. I emailed them countless time explaining the traffic and weather. They just kept sending me scripted responses on how long pick up fees work. I've done long pick ups during surge 20 min. received 7.00 but they were not hearing it this time. They also were telling riders my arrival time was what it usually takes no traffic or snow. Riders were getting annoyed. I had 3 or 4 cancel. I started texting riders my real arrival time so I wouldn't get anymore cancels.  Not worth it if traffic is heavy.
"Uber Instant Pay Glitch. What are your thoughts on the ""compensation""?",momof4,UberInstantP,0,"As we all know it was a rough ride for drivers over the weekend. No access on driver's app to see your trips, how much you made, and the worst part was you couldnt cash out to get paid. Drivers were unable to drive as they had no access to their pay. I also had issues with navagation. This isnt the first time this has happened. A few months back there was an issue with the instant pay. I waited a week for my pay last time this happened. Then it occured again a few days later, although this time they fixed it in 32 hrs.I went on the app today and Uber is giving drivers free instant pay for 1 week. In case you dont drive free instant pay allows drivers to get their pay sent to bank account immediately for .50. I know drivers that lost 2 days of driving, bills they couldnt pay on time, or bills that bounced because money wasnt available. Uber is giving us .50 to 3.50 (if you cash out daily) to compensate for the trouble they caused. Just another way to say FY to its drivers, and to let us know they dont care. Take notice, rider app never goes down and Uber never has issues collecting rider money. Uber can take there .50 and shove it. Any thoughts from other drivers out there?"

There is no big difference with this new app but yet they make it seem like its a big deal and helps the drivers. The only thing that will help the drivers is to stop the lies, pay us what we deserve, treat us better. My booking fees have been increased since Sept 1st but yet I've received no notice no explanation. What's even stranger is its not on all trips some are 2.00 some are 2.20 for Uber X. Some are 2.50 for XL some are 2.60. There are pool trips that Uber made more than I did and its not because of booking fee at the time I only had 1 rider. Last night I had an Uber X trip that Uber made .26 less than I did. You send an email you get a scripted answer that dont answer your question. You call you get someone that is from another country that dont understand you and all they do is read a scripted answer.

The afternoon pickups are smooth but the morning pickups are not quite as good. I noticed several times Drivers will pick up my ride and be 4 minutes away in a subdivision across from me. Their car doesn’t move for 20 minutes and then I find out they were coming from home. I think it’s rude a driver picks up a route and is not ready to go making me late for work.

How can a passenger reject a driver after you have been paired and the ride accepted?,RacRay79,15837,15580,"I believe the cancellation fees are waived, if the driver is not making an active effort to get to you.  Uber had to implement this because some drivers started to do this, where they would just sit there and wait...until enough time passes and the rider cancels. (hence scoring them a cancellation fee)So,First, try your best to cancel bad drivers who don't start driving to you. Do this within 2 minutes.Second, if the driver is really not moving towards you, just cancel and call another. You either won't be hit by cancellation or you should be able to argue it."

Do you let your teens use Uber?,rainy114,12257,Doyouletyour,"Oops, didn’t know teens/kids were not allowed to ride Uber.  My girls have missed the bus.  We arranged an Uber to pick them up and drop each off at their schools.  The girls are 14 and 10.  I felt like it was way safer than the idea of calling a taxi (no name, car details, gps tracking).  Now, I am worried that a driver could refuse them. They haven’t missed the bus in months, so perhaps they are motivated by the hassle of rideshare versus joining their friends."

A lot of these child rideshare companies took on huge amounts of debt. (Like Uber who still hasn’t made a profit). Also parents don’t want to pay a huge up charge for rides. Kids are expensive enough right?  I plan to keep expenses low by operating out of my home.  The best asset are the drivers. - companies don’t get that.  So  our plan is to take as little as possible to maintain costs but we’ll stay virtual to avoid a huge overhead.   This means drivers can earn a real wage.   If you keep the drivers happy with bigger earning power AND not spend a ton of money  in office space and administration costs then I think we can pull it off.   I’m appalled at how little some drivers make.Jacqui Gordon Newport Beach  CA"

When I tell them I am doing it because I need flexibility while going to Nursing School their attitude changes drastically.

I pick people up from airport and drop people off at the airport.  I dont where they have been or what there hygiene is.  What I do know is I am in my car, my family is in my car I do not want any of us picking up any kind of illness. Furthermore I transport kids (with parents & car seats), and riders that have cancer, or are very old. Their immune systems are not the greatest. I do not want to be responsible for anyone catching any disease or illness because I was too cheap or lazy to spray some lysol.  My car is kept clean for my own sanity. I hate clutter and a dirty car. I am not a germaphobe but I see the things people do and dont do in public restrooms. It's absolutely disgusting. I've worked in healthcare my entire life there are certain illness, diseases that people may have that I dont know about because they may not share that info. Their immune systems are not strong enough to fight off bacteria/germs.  So with that being said I dont care what people think. I know my car is clean and if anyone gets sick most likely it wasnt from my car so not my fault:) Riders should look out for themselves by washing their hands especially after bring in public places . Most dont. Dont want them bringing their dirty bacteria infested hands in my car. Lol I use Lysol in the car but there are a few people I would've love to Lysol their entire body before they got in my car. I have a bottle of hand sanitizer in the back for riders. So far in the 3 months its been back there 3 riders have used it.Read less..."

People on vacation are in this weird bubble where they feel like anything goes and they can ditch their usual consideration (if they have any to begin with).Here in Boston I get annoyed in the winter when people don't bang their shoes together to get the slush off before getting in. It's such a simple thing but so many don't bother, and my floor is a salty dirty wreck by the end of the night!Also weed is legal in MA now and many people seem to think that makes it ok to stink up my car with weed.

DRIVER 'S SHORTAGE,WNOKECHI,DRIVER'SSHOR,0,"What Ride sharing companies UBER/LYFT don't understand or pay attention is that driver shortages it not drivers not refusing to go on the Road or signing up due to Pandemic It's not. Most Uber/Lyft drivers about 65% are undocumented immigrants and most of them their Licenses are expired and they cannot renew their driver's Licenses due to strict immigration regulations and that's why we have shortage of driver's,Rider sharing drivers should be considered as Essential workers and I think the company should lobby with the congress to remove strict immigration laws for undocumented immigrants. Some Drivers have moved out of state and relocated to those States that allow undocumented immigrants to renew or apply for driver's Licenses ,and therefore shortage of driver's will continue to increase when undocumented immigrants Licenses continue to expire each year."

If it is brought up, my simple reply is, ""If you feel I deserve a tip, it is greatly appreciated, however, tipping is not necessary"". I do believe that tipping should be an option for customers if they feel their driver was exceptional, but I also think that as a driver you should do your best to provide an exceptional experience without the expectation of a tip. I believe overall this allows you to relax and focus providing a better experience for your customer, who ultimately is the reason you are making any money at all."
What is the proper etiquette with tipping an Uber and Lyft driver?,Norm22,5206,5205,"I feel the same way. I have had days where every rider tipped, and those where no riders tipped.  It does make a huge difference when riders tip just a buck or two. I don't expect tips in general as where I live the locals just don't, period.  Most tips come from tourists or those visiting from out of town or are not paying for the trip (Corporate per diem). Uber is now taking a much higher percentage and charging the customer more on short trips to cover the minimum fees (Uber takes more than 50% on those rides). I think the matrix above is laughble, I don't tip on that kind of system, I also don't need a charge cord, gum or anything else. I tip for good service and a good / clean car and driver. There are some sketchy drivers out there too so you can't blanket tip like a restaurant. The driver is the busboy, cook, server and hostess. You are correct you cannot be hald accountble for what Uber does but you can control what you do."

What is the proper etiquette with tipping an Uber and Lyft driver?,DDominico69,3551,3548,Uber pays way too little.  In most cities we make below minimum wage.  Tip is the only way to make it work.  If I make $7 an hour before tip.  The tip makes it $8 or 9.  Do you see how important that is for us to stay in the profit range.

It's important to know ahead of time the best practices so you come out on top. We put together a step by step list to make it easy.Call the Police.It's one of the first questions we ask drivers when they call us after an accident: ""Did you file a police report?"". This is very important because if it wasn't your fault, now you have written proof.Be Polite but don't admit fault.If it turns out it wasn't your fault, the other drivers involved in the accident can use that against you.Don't move your vehicle unless told to do so.Get names, addresses, and telephone numbers of drivers and witnesses.If you had a passenger at the time, it's important you get their contact info before they leave.Exchange insurance information with the other drivers.Take pictures of the scene.Again this will aid you in the future, should they claim it's your fault when it wasn't.If you or your passengers are injured:Even if you THINK you may be OK, you (and/or your passengers) should always seek medical treatment immediately.It could take days for the pain to sink in, but it doesn't mean you weren't hurt on day one.Be specific when describing your injury to medical providers.ContactLegalRideshareI personally speak dozens of rideshare drivers every day and always stress these 9 steps, which were written by our attorneys.

Uber - Time is Soon - ready to go back to taxis yet?,WasabiNuts,Uber-TimeisS,0,"I feel like we reaching that point and have been for a long time. We all tried to like something and worked hard to make the transition, but this whole thing is overcomplicated and all the arrangement we made are starting to backfire. Maybe it's time we reverted back to taxis or just decide already the winner between taxis and Uber and moved on.  Let me share my experience.I landed at Logan Airport the other day. I called for an Uber as I walked inside the terminal thinking I am all that.  I stepped out into the cold and saw all these taxis just sitting in the queue. I walked by them, and continued to walk alongside the building. Immediately, I felt this to be unnatural. So many airports have designated Uber pickup areas and they are always so much further away.Then I got to the uncovered area where we are supposed to wait for the Uber. I saw people crowding, wandering about, sitting on their suitcases. I ended up waiting 20 minutes to get my car, where the driver said it's really busy.I see so much irony and inefficiencies in this. First of all, why do we have two pickup areas for taxis and Uber? Is this a failure of the lawmakers? How stupid is that I had to walk by numerous taxis and walk in the cold to get to the makeshift area? This airport has very limited real estate to begin with.  I know we all love Uber and its app (and price), but this isn't working.I think we are close to reaching the critical point where people will revert back to taxis. Why are people still using Uber at airports? It’s because of the cheaper price. But that’s about to change...because guess what. My app quoted me $40 but later revised it to $70. I don't even wawnt to know how much it would have been for a taxi.."

(good article)4) Vehicle Information: Look them up in the appOnce you have requested the ride and you have been matched up with a driver, look for the following information to help you identify the informationCar Make and ModelCar ColorLicense PlateThis information will help you identify the car as it approaches.5) Drivers: Contact your driverTry messaging or calling the driver with information such as:Letter of the TerminalNumber or Code identifying your location, such as Door #, Island #, Pikcup Area #, etc.Your appearance.Good luck!ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Apr 01, 2018"

Uber Eats or Doordash: Can a restaurant cancel a driver (or request a new one) if they have had issues with the driver before?,AndrewCalam,19196,UberEatsorDo,"The restaurants can cancel orders for pretty much any reason at all.

Uber Eats or Doordash: Can a restaurant cancel a driver (or request a new one) if they have had issues with the driver before?,SmittenKitten,19191,UberEatsorDo,"The mechanism is there on Uber or Doordash to deactivate bad drivers with bad reputation. More issues they have on their record, it's more likely they will be deactivated. The restaurants have to trust the system and continue to server the food. That's their part of the bargain, and they need to keep it up.It does stink that when something goes wrong with the order and a refund is issued to the customer, the restaurants do lose out on the food they served.  For cheap foods like pasta and sandwiches, it may not be a big deal, but for higher cost items like steaks and seafood, they can really lose out.  This is something each establishment has to assess and decide."
Uber Eats or Doordash: Can a restaurant cancel a driver (or request a new one) if they have had issues with the driver before?,changingtides,19194,19191,So if the driver messes up (tips the food upside down in the car) the restaurant has to pay? That seems quite unfair.
Uber Eats or Doordash: Can a restaurant cancel a driver (or request a new one) if they have had issues with the driver before?,AsStibelDude,19188,UberEatsorDo,"I don't know the answer but I think the restaurants just receive the order, prepare the food, and leave it there for the driver to take, right?

Usually, there are mutliple drivers online 24/7 for medium to large cities. However, to ease your mind, we recommend checking in on the Uber app a few days in advance at your designated time (6am).

The End of An Era: The New Uber Bonus Policy,TerryIrving,TheEndofAnEr,0,"Well, ladies and gentlemen, our happy(?) times with Uber are coming to an end.I'd like to find all those helpful Drivers who worked on the New App and ask them some pointed questions....This weekend, I think I've seen the future.1. All the bonus areas that were always present on a weekend, changing every hour to get cars to different areas, are gone. GONE. They would range from a 1.1 (10%) to a 2.0 (double) as the bars emptied and every Uber on the road was needed. GONE. They have been replaced by the Consecutive Ride Program where, if you take a ride in a box that LOOKS like the old bonus box, you can get a whole $5.00 bonus for three rides. $5.00 is not the same a 50% of a full fare.2. The new yellow surge zones aren't surge zones. You grab a ride that says ""2.00"" thinking that you'll double your fare to wherever. No no no. You're going to have 2.00 added to the fare. A five-dollar ride that's been doubled is $10.00. A $5 ride plus $2.00 extra is $7.00. Don't even think about a nice long ride to the suburbs after a baseball game lets out--you'll start to cry.3.

I guess Uber has found the way they've been looking for to shaft the drivers and make more profit to keep the investors happy.Oh yeah, they are going to punch up the Phone Home part of the app that autodials your loving spouse and tells them where you are. I tried that one night (it's always been a part of the app) and my loving wife told me that if one more call came in after she'd gone to sleep telling her where her wonderful husband was, I could just stay there for the foreseeable future. Let's not even talk about the colored screen feature. When it's that crowded, everyone is drunk anyway and guiding them in is like being the Air Traffic Controller on a moving aircraft carrier--having your clients holding up (or staring at) a colored screen ain't gonna help.I decided to drive Uber on Weekend Nights because there were always bonus blocks up and, even if I didn't pay particular attention to them, it meant about 10 to 30% more before the surge clouds descended. Now, both surge and bonus blocks are gone. I know it's August but I think we are seeing the future, friends. I've read that venture capital is still spending 40% of every trip and Uber had to squeeze more money out of its drivers (the self-driving car and helicopter nonsense is just a dog-and-pony show for investors). Well, here it is. Just by replacing percentage signs with dollar signs, they've reduced our pay by a third.Oh yeah, I forgot about the Quest. How much you receive for 65 rides in three days has always been individually assigned in an email--you get the email, you get the bonus. Have you noticed that if you complete the $195 Quest, you get the $185 Quest, then the $145 Quest all the way down to the $105 Quest? (You'd think if you were working hard enough to pull 65 rides in three days, you would get MORE not LESS but this is Uber.) I was down to $105 for two weekends where I didn't bother to kill myself for the money. What a surprise! They offered me $145 this weekend. I won't make it this weekend either (you can't do 30 rides in a day) so I suppose I'll be back up to $175 the next time. A friend of mine described this as ""point of pain"" management.So, fellow drivers, I know this is August but I'm getting the same amount of rides--Uber has always been popular in DC--I'm just not getting anything but, essentially, tip money for hitting the hot spots. I figure I'll just forget about baseball and football games or arena stage shows IF I continue to drive. I'm already looking for another way to make the mortgage.LoveTerryRead less..."
The End of An Era: The New Uber Bonus Policy,PeterAshlock,7583,TheEndofAnEr,"If you try to parse every single ride by what kind of scam Uber/Lyft are dangling in front of you then you will not make much, you cannot chase every carrot they dangle because they are essentially an illusion and always have been, right from the first so called surge priced fare. No one gets rich, but you will make a basic income if you accept virtually 95% or more of the fares as they are offered and take them without complaint. You make the system work for you, not by trying to play the system but by working and if you get a tip, that's nice, if you get a ""bonus"" fare, that's nice, the bottom line is very basic. If they offer you a couple of hundred bucks for taking so many fares in three days, then go for it, hit the number, if you know your way around, know where and when people are active, you won't have a lot of problems. Just don't expect much more from the company because they are not there for anyone but themselves, just like the drivers."

It's just a matter of time.Like most, I drive both Uber and Lyft. I had an interesting thing happen once that showed the difference in culture between the two companies. Both promise to pay bridge tolls. In the same week, Uber cheated me out of $1 (yes, a measely dollar), and Lyft neglected to pay me $6 that they owed me. I contacted both within 3 days. Uber gave me the runaround. I had to fill out and submit a bunch of forms. (None of this was worth the dollar, mind you, but it was the principle of the thing.)After about 2 weeks of this nonsense, they finally denied my claim for $1. They said in order to get it, I would have had to submit the forms within the first three days!Lyft, on the other hand, emailed me back right away and said, ""Sorry about that! We've just posted your $6 to your account.""So which company do you (as a driver) want to work for?"

What mechanisms are there to prevent vandalism and enforce accountability on Bird Scooter riders?,willygerald,6122,6075,Thats a good idea. I wonder if any of the companies have started doing that yet. You would think they want a system in place to avoid such damages and potential costs for them.
What mechanisms are there to prevent vandalism and enforce accountability on Bird Scooter riders?,chewy,6076,Whatmechanis,"They crowd source this. People get paid to pick the scooters up, bring them home, and charge them. If the scooter is damaged, then they know who last used it. I assume that if it's an isolated incident, they probably just let it go. After all someone could have come along and damaged it after the last person rode it. But if the same person keeps having damaged scooters they would probably ban them eventually is my guess."

BUT because we all know there is a catch,  well more than one. Surprise surprise. It's all fluff and PR to make it look like Uber cares and treats drivers well.  Public will think Uber is just wonderful. You have to maintain a certain acceptance rate above 85% , cancellation rate below 4% maybe not sure  about those numbers but if not correct very close.  Rating must be 5.85 I think, you have to maitain platnimum or diamond status and do X amt a trips per month.  As you can see its not so free. I would rather pay my own tuition than be a slave to Uber and  suck up to riders to maintain my rating. I would be highly upset if a few riders were the cause of losing my so called free tuition because they didnt like my air freshner or the many other stupid reasons they give lower than 5 stars to drivers. RedANT explains it well and BigFrank sums it up. Anything Uber gives comes with a cost to the driver."

Do drivers have hidden interior vehicle cameras?,Wes,11731,Dodrivershav,"There's certainly no reason to be ""freaked out""... you are recorded dozens if not hundreds of times a day and you never know it.  Security cameras are on virtually every business, every bank, everywhere you go.  Heck i have 4 in my house and getting ready to add more.If you aren't doing anything illegal, why worry about it?And yes, many drivers have cameras but they are within view, typically mounted on the front window or dash.  Most of these operate in both directions so it adds several layers of safety both for YOU as well as the driver.  I've never heard of a driver having elaborate hidden systems - those are very costly and if you knew how poorly being an Uber/Lyft driver actually paid, you would understand why the chances of anyone investing thousands into that type of system are virtually nill.Actually you should feel doubly safe when you enter an Uber that DOES have cameras as you have the assurance of knowing the driver isn't going to do anything foolish or aggressive either since it would all be on film!"

Welcome to reality!First of all, if you are not familiar with upfront pricing, please check this article here:What is upfront pricing?You are correct.  Uber does not have to honor the upfront pricing under some circumstances.  They have rules in place, but they are usually to do with the driver changing destinations or the route that drastically changed the distance or duration of the trip.Quote from Uber:When you request a ride, you agree to be charged the upfront fare when the trip ends. Your fare may increase if you travel to a different destination or make extra stops along the route, or the trip takes much longer than expected.If an upfront fare is not honored, you will either be charged the minimum fare or a fare based on the measured time and distance for your trip, including any base fare, booking fee, surcharges, tolls, and other relevant factors such as a dynamic pricing charge.You'll always get a receipt for any trip fare. If your fare is different than the upfront fare you agreed to, your receipt will explain why.As a result, some controversies arise:The Uber price didn't change, even after instructing the driver to take a different route.What happens when the Uber driver goes on a longer or bad route?Source:https://help.uber.com/h/d2d43bbc-f4bb-4882-b8bb-4bd8acf03a9dippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Nov 20, 2017"

A couple hours after our drop-off, I received a Lyft damage receipt for $15 and they charged my credit card right away. I disputed the damage and they emailed me a picture of a wet seat as a so called evidence - pretending that my wife peed her pants on our way to a fancy restaurant. The picture they provided was taken on a sunny day probably in the afternoon while we got dropped off at 730pm on a cloudy night. The scammer driver must have been using the same picture for all of her scams. Her name is Raiza and she is driving a Toyota Yaris in the Miami South Beach-Bal Harbour area. Do not ride with her. She is a scammer! As for Lyft, they refused to overturn this damage fee, siding with their scammer driver and her phony evidence.

In most cases, these aren't publicly announced either.Uber defines rules, regulations, service types, promotional campaigns, etc. for each market, so many of these decisions are made at the city level.What makes it even more difficult is that for new features, they do not always segment by cities.  Uber may pick certain neighborhoods within a city (e.g. say a suburb) or even specific demographic of the drivers."

Seen driver suggestions that say to add sign, box  or both.I have riders that say they purposely dont tip if drivers have boxes, signs, or the driver flat out asks for tip.Riders: What is your opinion? Do you think it is good idea? Tacky? Rude?  Would you be more apt to tip if sign or box was in car? Or Would it make you not want to tip?Drivers: Do you have sign? Box? Both?

Drivers/ Riders How do you feel about a driver having a sign up about tipping in their vehicle or an actual tip box in their car???,fpressly,8881,Drivers/Ride,"I drive for both Uber and Lyft. The issue of tips has been a sore spot for years. Before Uber began tinkering with the fares and reducing drivers income, tips were not that big a deal as good money was being made by all. When Lyft included tipping in their app, I thought that would improve the picture. However, to the contrary, I have learned that when a rider is not on the carpet as far as giving the driver a tip (cash hand to hand), that they will not tip. After Uber began messing with the fares and significantly impacting the bottom line, they also decided to add tipping to their app.I do not have tip boxes as they tend to look a little crude and presumptive. However, I do have a small sign on the back of the seats that say, ""Tipping is an act of appreciation for a service well rendered."" Telling them WHY they should tip, puts the ball in their court. It is then up to them if they think the service was well rendered and if they appreciated it. Cash tips allow the driver to take that into consideration before they rate their rider."

Riders are more likely to take an Uber when it's surging 2.1 times than 2.0.,ippei,Ridersaremor,0,"Riders are more accepting of surges that are NOT round numbers, because consumers feel more thoughts went into the calculation of the surge pricing. This was shared on an interview at NPR, where Uber's economist shared a factor in when people are accepting of surge pricing.From an Uber rider's perspective, Keith says, a round number surge like two times looks like the company is just slapping on a higher price tag because it's raining. But when it's 2.1 times as much, we think there must be a complex algorithm (which there is) coming up with that figure. The ride, then, is surelyworth2.1 times as much. (source)Similar research with eBay:Economists found sellers who priced their goods with round numbers (i.e. $50 instead of $49)sold their itemsquicker. The researchers hypothesize that round numbers signal the sellers' impatience to sell and, thus, their willingness to accept a lower price. In other words, round numbers signal carelessness or imprecision."

They only know it's surged if they normally take that route and price is higher than usual. Uber doesnt breakdown the price for the rider showing a surge. In area when surge is still multiplier do riders see how much the surge is?  In reality I would wait out the surge if ride was really expensive."
Riders are more likely to take an Uber when it's surging 2.1 times than 2.0.,ippei,14831,14099,"That's correct! Uber's rider app no longer shows the surge pricing multiplier - in all regions. This has been replaced by ""upfront pricing"" as Uber claims that it eliminates confusion and encourages users to keep using their apps.So they figured people rather not know when the price is surging. They just prefer knowing what the price will be.They removed the lightning bolts for the surge prices as well.  Great point."
Riders are more likely to take an Uber when it's surging 2.1 times than 2.0.,momof4,14098,Ridersaremor,"I live in Philadelphia and 2 blocks from Bucks County (Bensalem PA).  I believe we went to dollar amt. between May 2018 - August 2018. I get trips into NJ and they are still going by multiplier surge. The highest I've seen is 2.8X. I ended up in Princeton a few weeks ago when they were having their annual reunion. I was not aware of this at the time. I was headed back on 295 when my phone was blowing up with surged rides including a few Long Trips with multiplier surge. Their rates are lower than Philly. .87 Base Fare, .66 per mile, and .1725 per min. Not that Philly's rates are much higher."
Riders are more likely to take an Uber when it's surging 2.1 times than 2.0.,EricH1973,14829,14098,"That seems low, but the capitalism plays out.  As long as there are still people willing to drive (and enough of them), Uber will continue to lower the prices."
Riders are more likely to take an Uber when it's surging 2.1 times than 2.0.,kendallM,14106,14098,"I am pretty new to this whole rideshare thing but those prices for Princeton are crazy low. .87 cents, .66cents etc. WOW! I can't understand how this would ever be profitable."

Riders are more likely to take an Uber when it's surging 2.1 times than 2.0.,davescully,14105,Ridersaremor,"Huh, it is almost like the .99 concept."
Riders are more likely to take an Uber when it's surging 2.1 times than 2.0.,EricH1973,14135,14105,"But  the irony is that on a site like eBay, people were likely to buy more if it’s $1.00 than $0.99"
Riders are more likely to take an Uber when it's surging 2.1 times than 2.0.,mrboldman007,14088,Ridersaremor,Are riders seeing multipliers even though the driver sees a flat dollar amount for the surge?
Riders are more likely to take an Uber when it's surging 2.1 times than 2.0.,KitteryMe,14830,14088,The opposite happens. Not sure about what you said.
Riders are more likely to take an Uber when it's surging 2.1 times than 2.0.,BenRosen,14091,14088,"On a similar topic, do riders even see surges as multipliers anymore?  Or is it all upfront pricing?"

Uber driver from hell,gabre1,Uberdriverfr,0,"Took an Uber from the hotel to MEM airport Sep 23 and the Uber was filthy, smelled of weed, and driver very unprofessional. Was 2 of us in a rush or I would have never taken that Uber. After dropping of at the airport the driver claimed I left my phone in the car and we were charged a fee for a returned item. A week later he claimed we spilled coffee in his car and we were charged a cleaning fee. None of us had any coffee which can be confirmed by concierge at the hotel. The most frustrating thing of all this is just being able to reach Uber easily I guess. I feel like this driver is harassing us even after the ride. I don’t think I will ever feel safe in an Uber again especially since they seem to not even ask you what happened and just charge your card when a driver complains. They need cameras in those cars."
Uber driver from hell,changingtides,19953,Uberdriverfr,"This doesn't even make sense, I mean can't you easily prove you did not leave your phone in the car by showing that you never filed a lost item ticket?"

How Reckless Loans Devastated a Generation of Taxi Drivers,Samarov,HowRecklessL,0,How long till a story like this about UberLyft?http://bit.ly/TaxiCon
How Reckless Loans Devastated a Generation of Taxi Drivers,LockieTavish,13647,HowRecklessL,"Already happening. Maybe not as bad as buying a medallion, but I know people who are buying cars on a crazy loan in hopes they will successfully start up third Uber business. I’ve also seen UberX drivers buy a luxury car to bump themselves up to UberBlack, and these are people who have no business taking large loans on nice cars.All I can think about is that the risk is too high. One deactivation can ruin a driver.Gotta think twice of making it a business when the job was originally designed to be a part-time, off-the-cuff, side job."
How Reckless Loans Devastated a Generation of Taxi Drivers,Bigfrank,18352,13647,I would never buy a lux car to do taxi work for poverty income.
How Reckless Loans Devastated a Generation of Taxi Drivers,outlandish,13682,HowRecklessL,"It all comes down to cities screwing the medallion system up. They should never have allowed a scarce commodity like taxi medallions to be transferable. Doing so led to a secondary market with ridiculous values, so of course greed comes into play and predatory practices like this pop up all over the place.There is a similar problem with liquor licenses in a lot of cities. Restaurants have to buy them on a secondary market for hundreds of thousands of dollars because the city only allows X licenses.  So they have to take out loans to do it. Then one day the city decides to stop limiting liquor licenses, or increase the pool of licenses. Now the value of a license plummets, and all those restaurants that took out loans for their liquor license are under water."
How Reckless Loans Devastated a Generation of Taxi Drivers,lionfool,13689,13682,"The thing is, if someone tried an ""uber for liquor"", without a license, there is no way they'd get away with it. They'd get shut down immediately by the city. No question about it. Yet these same cities let Uber come in and operate unregulated for so long. Maybe you are right that they screwed up the medallion system to begin with, but they also really screwed up by not protecting the taxi industry when they should have. They should never have let uber run rampant. They were way too slow to react, and they still haven't, and now Uber is powerful enough that they never will. The amazing thing is that that seems to be universal. There is no city that I know of that actually responded to Uber's appearance on the scene, at all. just a complete clusterfk."
How Reckless Loans Devastated a Generation of Taxi Drivers,Bigfrank,18351,HowRecklessL,I can't speak for all but here in NYC the medallion owners got the royal shaft and their case is still in court. Any for hire vehicle should always be priced higher then a yellow cab and that should be a law for a fair game . We do not need a Uber for every resident in NYC nor do we need uber x  and pool is now cess pool officially. On top of this fair game should be a  mandatory 15% surcharge that goes directing to the driver because of A holes who think tipping is a trend or two dollars is good for a $50 fare.
“What Have We Done?”: Silicon Valley Engineers Fear They've Created a Monster,chicago49,“WhatHaveWeD,0,"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/silicon-valley-engineers-fear-they-created-a-monster“There’s something you need to know,” she said in a low voice, “and I don’t want you to forget it. When you’re writing code, you need to think of the drivers. Never forget that these are real people who have no benefits, who have to live inthis city,who depend on us to write responsible code. Remember that.” I didn’t understand what she meant until several weeks later, when I overheard two other engineers in the cafeteria discussing driver bonuses—specifically, ways to manipulate bonuses so that drivers could be “tricked” into working longer hours. Laughing, they compared the drivers to animals: “You need to dangle the carrot right in front of their face.” Shortly thereafter, a wave of price cuts hit drivers in the Bay Area. When I talked to the drivers, they described how Uber kept fares in a perfectly engineered sweet spot: just high enough for them to justify driving, but just low enough that not much more than their gas and maintenance expenses were covered.That's pretty tough to read. But it's not like we didn't know this was true already. Of course they are going to try and maximize profits, at the driver's expense. That's what businesses do. Heck they have a responsibility to do that. That's their whole reason for existence, right?"

“What Have We Done?”: Silicon Valley Engineers Fear They've Created a Monster,PeterAshlock,7227,7033,"One thing that seems to be forgotten in all the comments about ""guaranteed wage"" is that taxi drivers have no guaranteed wage either. Their system is more fair to the driver though because it is structured to include the costs of doing business in the fare. The taxi driver pays a flat fee to the company to ""rent"" the car for the shift, they are then responsible only for the gas. That flat fee covers all the issues regarding the vehicle, insurance, maintainance, wear and tear, depreciation, etc. Thus the driver is only responsible for the income generated after they have covered their ""nut"", the gate fee for taking the car out. After the unions lost their power, the taxi drivers also had no benefits."

Never seen one that high ever.  Not even close.This is a bit off topic, but drivers with higher ratings shuold be qualified for higher fares/rates.  Instead of leaning on the undefined tip system to work, won't this work to motivate drivers to do their jobs better?"

"I have a dashcam in my car, but I keep hearing I’m not allowed to record passengers unless they know about it, or agree to it. Is that true?",Jaredhoffa,Ihaveadashca,0,"We get asked this question a lot atLegalRideshareand this is how we break it down.First, we always have to consider, ""is a Uber or Lyft a private situation?"" We often lean on the side of ""no, it's not."" It's comparable to taking public transportation like a bus  in a major city. We always tell passengers, ""if you wouldn't go outside and scream something  absurd, I wouldn't say it in an Uber"".The issue lies on the fact that passengers aren't always aware of the laws (or lack thereof) and are looking for their rights to be protected.So how do you protect yourself?We always recommend getting a sticker for the back window of your car, acknowledging there's a dashcam (we have these stickers, so please reach out and we'll mail them to you). In states like  Illinois, which is two-party consent, this really covers any issue that may arise. It's also important to let riders know this is for their benefit as well, in case of an accident or assault.When does it go too far?A few months ago a driver was livestreaming his passengers on twitch. This is not only a breach of trust, but a guaranteed deactivation. Recording passengers in case of an accident is one thing. Using them for a reality TV show is another.You can check out ourinterview with ABC Newswhere we go into more details about recording passengers."
"I have a dashcam in my car, but I keep hearing I’m not allowed to record passengers unless they know about it, or agree to it. Is that true?",Wes,13787,Ihaveadashca,"The ""rules"" vary by State.  Some states like my own only require that ONE person is aware of the recording device - and that would be ME LOL.  However if I did have a camera, I would post a banner stating that a recording device is in use as I feel this helps ""set a tone"" for the passengers behavior."
"I have a dashcam in my car, but I keep hearing I’m not allowed to record passengers unless they know about it, or agree to it. Is that true?",CarrieB78,14065,13787,"Wouldn't there always be at least ONE person aware of the recording? I mean, whoever owns the camera and/or set it up?  LOL."

"I have a dashcam in my car, but I keep hearing I’m not allowed to record passengers unless they know about it, or agree to it. Is that true?",LG-PA,13906,13899,"I would view it in same manner as being on a public transport. Nobody would (normally) expect a public bus or an Uber to offer similar privacy as their bedroom, so there should be no issues with dashcam. The few times I was asked if they were being recorded I said Yes, for everyone's privacy. The dash cam is in plain view. If they ask wheter I am suppose to alert passengers of recording, I tell them that by the virtue of them engaging in conversation with me (in two party consent states) they automatically give their consent. In one party consent I consent myself to record interior of my privately owned vehicle. If they do not like it or ask me to turn it off (never happened yet), next street corner is where their ride ends"

You want personalized rides hire a car service or limo with a professional driver.  I know this may sound harsh but its the reality of it. You get what you pay for.Cameras are everywhere now a days. No where in public is safe. Everyone has a phone and everyone is quick to pull it out and record. People have cameras in their homes and you would never know it.

Would you ask your friend to turn off the camera while you are visiting their house?Remember these are our private cars, and we are recording inside our private cars that we allow you to ride in.

"I have a dashcam in my car, but I keep hearing I’m not allowed to record passengers unless they know about it, or agree to it. Is that true?",CarrieB78,14074,14071,"Good points, Leonard.  I totally understand how drivers need to protect themselves.  With that said, I hope you can understand my point as well.Also, there is a difference in one being recorded versus being ""seen"" or ""heard."" This is why there are different set of rules for recording situations. Back to my three points, I don't mind if my driver overheard my conversations or saw me sleeping.  I do mind if the driver took a photo of me or recorded the conversations.BTW, I am not sure if I completely agree with your comparison against the bus. I'd like to think that the ""level"" of expectation would be different on a public bus from a private car."
"I have a dashcam in my car, but I keep hearing I’m not allowed to record passengers unless they know about it, or agree to it. Is that true?",LeonardGirsh,14086,14074,"I do understand your concerns indeed, there are idiot drivers out there who use cameras not to just keep everyone safe but to live stream. But back to my argumentA bus, a supermarket, bank, a small jewelry store, a cab, a rideshare car all fall under a public space (in my opinion), except the fitting and restrooms obviously.Just like a jewelry store owner or any other business, records their  premises for safety, so do the rideshare drivers.A rideshare driver is a contractor who in essence runs his/her business and the premises happen to be their vehicles. Thus they have every right to record inside of their premises, just like the bank or jewelry store owner. If as a consumer would come up to a bank manager and ask the surveillance cameras be turned off because consumer feels uncomfortable I think we all know that you would just be asked to bank elsewhere ;) same for drivers.Had we operated Porto Johns and decided to record inside them, yes not allowed. Inside our cars that are operated and open for dressed passengers (public) we can record for everyone’s safety ;)"

What is the official rating threshold that Uber will deactivate a driver at?,scantilysam,Whatistheoff,0,Does anyone on here know what rating you cannot go below? I feel like it keeps changing?
What is the official rating threshold that Uber will deactivate a driver at?,Wes,13369,Whatistheoff,The threshold varies by market.  It is a well established fact that certain geographies rate more liberally or more conservatively and thus there is no single number for the entire US.  However the long standing number for reference and concern is 4.65  and we can assume once you see any version of 4.xx you should be mildly concerned.
What is the official rating threshold that Uber will deactivate a driver at?,scantilysam,13435,13369,Thanks Wes. I wonder why certain areas have different numbers? Different supply/demand of drivers? I would guess the threshold is lower in rural areas where there are hardly any drivers to begin with.

I also dont think anyone would go back that long ago to do so but why even give that option?
What is the official rating threshold that Uber will deactivate a driver at?,johndavidT,13322,Whatistheoff,It's honestly quite hard to get your rating that low. You would almost have to try to get deactivated.

What is the official rating threshold that Uber will deactivate a driver at?,jeffrey1987,13313,Whatistheoff,I think it is 4.6? At least that is the last I knew so unless they have changed it recently.

Uber introduced a “de Blasio view” in its ride-hailing app, blaming long wait times on Mayor Bill de Blasio. Celebrities like Ashton Kutcher and Kate Upton voiced their support for Uber on Twitter.The mayor was forced toback away from the planin 2015.Now, Uber is gearing up for another fight, this time over aproposal by the City Council for a yearlong capon for-hire vehicle licenses. But the political terrain has shifted substantially, and this time it is Uber on the defensive.Over the last three years, Uber and other ride-hail companies have added tens of thousands of vehicles to New York’s roads, prompting growing alarm over congestion and low driver wages.Uber’s reputation has also taken a beating over accusations of gender discrimination and harassment and other scandals. Its new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, has tried to adopt a friendlier, more cooperative approach.At the same time, there have been signs of a broader disillusionment with Silicon Valley in cities across the country. New York is also movingto rein in Airbnb, another popular service that has threatened the hotel industry.On Friday, Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, said he was confident about passing the legislation for a cap and other regulations for the for-hire vehicle industry.

Declining Long Distance Short Rides,PattyMelt,DecliningLon,0,Many drivers like myself drive for multiple companies to reduce downtime. Since Uber recently added trip duration to the ride request timer information do you feel life it is too risky accepting Lyft/Via/Etc requests?Personally I find it quite excellent declining those 10 ++ minute away 1 minute trip rides. Even more common are the 20 minute ++ duration rides in the epicenter of a surge zone. You will lose out on tons of income taking that long trip out of the surge zone into the suburbs or etcIt’s been Uber all the way since this UberPro feature unlocked. Anyone else feeling this way too?
Declining Long Distance Short Rides,LG-PA,12465,DecliningLon,is trip duration only on for drivers at certain tier level or to all in your market? What market do you drive in?
Declining Long Distance Short Rides,PattyMelt,12477,12465,UberPro unlocks it. It used to require diamond or platinum but they changed it recently to include gold. It really is a blessing I can’t tell you how many times they try to send me considerably far away for a laughably short trip.
Declining Long Distance Short Rides,LG-PA,12479,12477,"But if for gold status you have to keep a certain acceptance rate, would you not lose gold if you decline a bunch of crappy rides?Where do you drive ?"
Declining Long Distance Short Rides,PattyMelt,12480,12479,I was worried about that also in the beginning. It hasn’t been a problem however I don’t think my acceptance rate has dropped below 96% at any point.I kind of drive all over Chicago and it’s burbs except for Kyle’s area lol That area sucks to do Uber. Not just moneywise but everybody has a black pick up truck and it’s a competitive game out there harassing Uber drivers on the road. Kind of like March madness except forget basketball and it’s all year long not just March.

Uber and Lyft made driving for rideshare sound like drivers could make decent money and all they have done is take,  take, take away from the driver it seems to never stop. They dont care about drivers, so many good drivers are no longer driving. Some of these new drivers and probably some veteran drivers are doing whatever they can to make money. Is it fair to the riders? Some of them yes more than fair. Other riders that are decent, kind, polite, no unfortunately not fair to them.  As much as you think drivers scam riders there are riders scaming drivers all the time.  We get fares taken away because riders make up lies about the driver. Uber dont want to hear our side, they take the fare away. So before we start bashing drivers for ""cherry picking"" you need to first know what it's like to own your own business, know what its like to go out of your way for a few bucks only to have it taken away because a rider wants a free ride. I get a ping for a ride request 10.27 min 3.77 miles away (sometimes the time & distance are longer). I will make .7 for the long pick up. I get to my rider who is drunk I wait 3 min for them to come out of bar & get into my car, i then drive them 4 min 1.57 miles up the road for 3.43. If anyone out there thinks this is fair I really want to know your reasoning/logic on that. Is it fair for driver to call rider and ask where they are going, find out its a short distance, then tell rider to cancel or the driver cancels. No absolutely not. I am the sole provider for my 4 kids so if I choose to take certain rides and not others than your damn right I ""cherry pick"". My family is my main concern, food, clothing, shelter, and their health.  However I never call my rider to ask where they are going if its a short ride I do it and treat rider just like any other rider. I dont accept a ride then cancel it unless its a minor or child with no safety seat. Riders need to stop assuming we are all mean, horrible, drivers that dont care. Drivers need to stop assuming every passenger is mean, rude, ignorant, and cheap. Uber and Lyft created this because they take the drivers money and scam the rider out of more money than the ride should be. However its not the driver getting the extra money. They have riders rate drivers and vice versa so that became an issue. Riders rate drivers low for dumb reasons and drivers rate riders low for dumb reasons. So instead of driver against rider, rider against driver we all need to be pissed and annoyed at the companies who created this. Place the blame where it belongs.Read less..."

I can’t think of a single place I’ve ever worked that didn’t have some big-time wackos working there.We really don’t have many options for expressing our grievances as rideshare drivers. One option however that has worked for me in the past is reaching out to your state or county attorney generals office.  You will be speaking with some low-level intern but they did wonders for me last year.  Ever since that ordeal I have a perfect 5.0 rating with one of the rideshare companies.

Declining Long Distance Short Rides,ScottWhite,12500,DecliningLon,"I don't drive, just a regular passenger. I looked at this post with a mixed emotion but after a few seconds I realized that this is a good thing. It's a good thing that drivers get to know how long the ride may be. You know why?Drivers will stop scamming people.  They accept a ride and if they don't like it they just sit there, ignore your calls, and wait until the passenger cancels.I think it's madness and I cannot believe this is allowed. I was told by someone to never cancel on behalf of the driver, because that's what they want you to do.  Once I was in Miami airport and the driver claimed his car was broken, as he sat right outside the airport.  I knew he didn't want to drive to Miami Beach. I never cancelled that ride, and had my friend call another.The driver even called me to cancel. I didn't.  Then he had the audacity to drive over (on his BROKEN) car and start the trip from the airport.  He did stop the ride in 1 minute, but he got paid the pickup fee and rated me 1-star. WHAT MADNESS IS THIS?"
Declining Long Distance Short Rides,ScottWhite,12501,12500,"Sorry, I lost it there for a minute. LOL. What I was trying to convey here is that this new rule, whatever it is, may help drivers from doing this crap."
Declining Long Distance Short Rides,PattyMelt,12522,12501,"lol  after what you described I think losing it sounds appropriate. I will say this, there are a lot of wannabe rideshare companies hoping they can take over the market.  If one of these companies allowed the riders and drivers the option to have the ride recorded with video and audio via dash cam I’m pretty sure that company would do very well. You would weed out a lot of the problematic drivers and passengers reeeeeal fast or at least keep them on their best behavior."
Declining Long Distance Short Rides,B-girlAnderson11,12526,12522,"I thought many drivers do record their rides on their webcam?

Declining Long Distance Short Rides,ErasDrivingCo,12497,DecliningLon,"I do love it. All these abilities to cherry-pick your rides keep me sane. An ability to schedule my days through an ability to choose a trip length and which direction (destination filter - those that’s up in the air, I guess) will keep many drivers happy without sacrificing the quality of service.I assume this only works if there’s a certain saturation level of drivers in any given city.  I do worry, say for example, if everyone declined short rides, that no passenger will be able to find short rides.  I assume Iner figured it out."

Declining Long Distance Short Rides,ErasDrivingCo,12589,12519,1 to 1? So if the pickup is 10 minutes the ride has to be more than 10 minutes.  Fair enough.
Declining Long Distance Short Rides,momof4,12499,DecliningLon,If you are waiting longer than usual it could be because of your rating. I will not pick up a passenger with a 4.60 (drivers are deactivated at this rating) or lower after 10pm.  However during the day I will pick up but not below a 4.50. If you find yourself waiting check your rating. Thete are drivers that wont pick up below 4.75.
Declining Long Distance Short Rides,KellyEbt,12523,12499,So you have a different threshold at night. Why is that? I assume safety is involved but it’s not like being attacked is good at any time of the day.Or is there something different. Say low rating during the day is different from low rating during the night?
Declining Long Distance Short Rides,momof4,12527,12523,"During the day I feel safer. More traffic on road. Late at night, people being drunk, too risky. As a driver its dufficult to protect yourself. Your in a confined area, in a seatbelt, operating a vehicle. You use mace in your car you are going to feel effects, knife too difficult to maneuver, even a gun would be difficult. Being a female I am not taking that chance. Although I wouldnt suggest a male picking that person up. Too many things had to happen to have rating that low. Uber tends to take riders side so if something did happen probably wouldnt believe driver anyway. Uber protects rider at all costs. Drivers are easily replaced. You can see that just by ratings. As I mentioned in ladt post driver is deactivated at a 4.60. If passenger rating below that doesnt matter still able to request rides."

Drivers cherry picking the requests.Or does this happen before it even matches me up with a driver? When you say declining is that canceling or does the request just go to another driver?"
Declining Long Distance Short Rides,CWalcutt75,12495,12494,"Good question.  The poster is referring to before the driver accepts the ride so this “declining” is completely hidden from the customer. To you, the passenger, it’s all happening behind the scenes while the Uber app is spinning.This basically gives the drivers to pick the type of rides they want. Happy drivers, better service.The worst thing is that it may take slightly longer for your Uber app to find you a driver."
Declining Long Distance Short Rides,KWalkins,12588,DecliningLon,What is UberPro. Is that like some earned status for good drivers?  By ratings or something else?Sorry. Non-driver here. Just curious.
Declining Long Distance Short Rides,BGraft89,12496,DecliningLon,I don’t think I have this feature. I’m an Uber Pro. At least I think I am.I’m in Boston
Declining Long Distance Short Rides,JakeGunther,12455,DecliningLon,Hm I don't think it is too risky to decline some of those worse trips and take trips on other platforms. Maybe start off with being fairly lenient and taking some of the bad rides the first few weeks os Uber doesn't catch on?
Declining Long Distance Short Rides,momof4,12463,12455,Uber catches on to everything. If they dont figure it out for themseves all they have to do is watch you tube video (lol) or rideshare websites to see and hear what goes on. I am sure their algorithms tell them everything they need to know within a short period of time:)
When will it be safe to undelete Uber? [Slate],brownbear,Whenwillitbe,0,"https://slate.com/business/2018/07/can-uber-ceo-dara-khosrowshahi-fix-a-toxic-culture.html...At most companies, this kind of volatility at the top of the org chart would be of interest mainly to investors and employees. At Uber, however, it’s more widely relevant, given how many people have switched to Lyft or deleted Uber from their phones in protest at the company’s culture and values. The #deleteuber campaign led to thedefenestrationof founder Travis Kalanick as CEO; hisreplacementby the kindler, gentler Khosrowshahi was not in and of itself sufficient to get those customers back. Which raises the question: When, if ever, will it be OK to undelete Uber? ......If you deleted Uber because you don’t want to reward Travis Kalanick for being an asshole, then, well, you should keep it deleted, since Kalanick remains Uber’s largest shareholder, and every time you use the app, you make him a little bit wealthier. And if you deleted Uber because you think it shouldtreat its drivers as employeesrather than independent contractors, then similarly there’s no indication that’s going to change."

I need drivers help. Long Pick up fee issues with Uber. Need clarification.,momof4,Ineeddrivers,0,July 4th took a 20 min long pick up. It was a surged ride. Time 10.12 min distamce 6.54 miles I was pd. 7.00 for long pick up. Now FF yesterday surged ride also 1.72 miles and 5 min. The 5 min is wrong it was a 47 min minus the 10 for threshold so 37 min. Was pd 2.52. For 5 min. I've emailed support they are not understanding that there is was a storm and traffic was heavy. They are basing it off the time it shouldve took minus traffic and weather. When request came in yesterday Uber was giving false arrival and destination times as they were not using real time accounting for traffic and weather conditions. Am i wrong or should i be paid for the 37 min it actually took?
I need drivers help. Long Pick up fee issues with Uber. Need clarification.,jeffrey1987,10369,Ineeddrivers,I always thought it was based on the time is actually took. What exactly is Uber saying back to you? Can you paste the emails here?
I need drivers help. Long Pick up fee issues with Uber. Need clarification.,momof4,10372,10369,Once you go over the treshold 10 min here in Phila you get long pick up fee miles and min. I have to get someone who knows how to paste the emails unfortunately I am illiterate when it comes to tech. Basically they kerp sending how long pick up fees work. Its burnt in my screen i received the same answer so many times. Lol what it seems like is they are not aknowledging the traffic and weather that day. They pd me like 5 min extra for one and 2 min on other. When in reality it was( -10 min) 26 which would be 16 min pd and 47 which would be 37 min pd. When the trips were accepted that day both my app and rider app were stating normal pick up times ex. 1st trip was 12 min 2nd trip was  12 min  had it not been snowing at rush hour entire philly and lower bucks was backed up everywhere entire areas were surged. They are not understanding it was not a normal day and i know for a fact when a trip is surged long pick up fees are more money. I hope this makes sense but ill work on getting that stuff uploaded to here. I am just pissed he may only be an extra 5/15.00 but just tired of Ubers BS. Thank you
I need drivers help. Long Pick up fee issues with Uber. Need clarification.,BrianTheScrewDriver,10354,Ineeddrivers,"It should be by the actual time it took.  Of course!  Isn't that how we are paid when we drive our passengers?  If there are excessive traffic jam or whatever, it switches over to distance/duration calculation. (I think.)  If the passenger changes destinations, the upfront pricing goes out the window, and it goes back to distasnce/duration calculation too.The same logic and accommodations should be applied for long pickup."
I need drivers help. Long Pick up fee issues with Uber. Need clarification.,momof4,10357,10354,Thats what I thought. Thats how I was paid in July but apparently we didnt get that memo they changed it or Uber support must get a commision on any money they screw the driver out of. I have sent 9 messages to them and still getting the scripted answer that is now forever burned in my brain and my phone screen. I am not letting this go. Going to call tomorrow. I was screwed out of a total of 56 min on 2 trips. Although I may be deactivated by morning. Lets just say the last message I sent was far from nice extremely rude and possibly bordering on inappropriate. I've just had enough.
I need drivers help. Long Pick up fee issues with Uber. Need clarification.,DaimsLer,10355,10354,"Well, you know why it isn't. It's because if a driver knows that there will be a long pickup fee, he or she will spend a long time driving around just to score a higher pay."
I need drivers help. Long Pick up fee issues with Uber. Need clarification.,momof4,10362,10355,I get that. Normally yes those rides would've never taken that long. Rider would've have cancelled my ass had that been a normal day. I've explained over and over that it was heavy traffic due to snowy conditions. If Uber didnt believe it that could contact the rider or check local weather for the day (yes i get that will not do it). There has to be a way to deal with this. What drivers in their right mind would ever drive in bad weather or bad traffic ever if this were to happen all the time. My 1st ride was approx 26 min to pick up another 35 min to drop off for 20.50 & she tipped 20%. 2nd ride was 77 min. 31.00. Had there been no surge it wouldve been 13.00 & 11.00. No way would i ever drive again for that. In July I had a 20 min long pick up (10 is threshold here) i was pd. 7.00 long pick up fee. Uber is so inconsistent. Customer service is beyond awful.

Dont know what driver would take their time for 1.00 or less. Maybe on a surge. Maybe rates are better elsewhere but definately not here in Philly. My logic is why waste dragging time out on a long pick up fee on a non surged ride when I csn get the ride done faster snd move on to a possibly better trip or someone who may tip.Read less...

Here are the strategies she recommends from her time on the job.Keep Snacks and Water HandyWhen you’re going to be on the road for hours, it’s important to make sure you have everything you need to be comfortable.Guendelsberger advises making sure you have snacks and water in your car — but not for passengers.She suggests keeping yourself well fed and hydrated while you’re working, so you don’t have to waste time and money on takeout.Know the Local BathroomsScope out available restroom facilities in the areas where you usually drive. Guendelsberger emphasizes the need to find public bathrooms with free parking, which can be difficult to find in downtown areas.She found Whole Foods and suburban Starbucks to be some of her best bets around Philly, with free parking and unlocked restrooms.Of course, every area will have different options, but make sure you know what’s around before you desperately need to use a restroom.Don’t Follow the HerdGuendelsberger found she made more money by ignoring the recommended times and locations where demand for rides was likely to be high.These are areas like popular morning commute routes, busy Saturday night bars and the stadium when a Flyers game had just finished.She found she actually made more money by ignoring these hot spots.When drivers flocked to a recommended area, Uber’s surge pricing — premium prices based on a lack of drivers in an area — would decrease, meaning those drivers would earn less for each ride.Drive up the Surge FaresTo take full advantage of surge fares, Guendelsberger recommends gaming the system a bit.She suggests logging out of the driver app before times you can anticipate surge fares, such as when the bars close.In Philly, she found 2 a.m. to 2:30 a.m. was a huge time for surge pricing as drinkers found their way home for the night.She recommends logging out of the driver app around 1:50 a.m. or so, waiting 15 minutes and logging back in to take advantage of surge fares.Logging out reduces the number of drivers in the area and drives up the fares. It also prevents you from getting a fare, at say, 1:55 a.m., and missing out on surge pricing.Don’t Drive Around EndlesslyDriving around in circles in an attempt to get to an area where Uber will ping you to pick up a fare isn’t going to do much more than add wear and tear to your vehicle, Guendelsberger found.She recommends sticking to a central area and avoiding the suburbs if possible.If you’re driving miles and miles to reach someone, there’s a good chance you’ll drive much further to meet them than you’ll wind up taking them. You can’t tell where a rider wants to go until you pick them up. This usually means drivers end up losing money on a far-away fare.She also says if you’re driving a long way to pick someone up, they may get bored and cancel the ride or find another way to get to their destination.Don’t Chase Surge Fares (but If You Do, Try This Hack)Guendelsberger found racing to a surge fare area never panned out for her. Other drivers would also head to that area, and the surge pricing period would be over by the time she reached it.But she has a tip for those looking to capitalize on surge pricing:Log out of the driver app and log into the passenger app until you reach the surge area,then log out of the passenger app and back into the driver one.Why does it work? Uber calculates surge fares based on the ratio of people with the passenger app open to the driver app in an area at any given time. This hack sways the system a bit, letting the app think you’re a passenger looking for a ride instead of adriver ready to offer one.Use the Uber Passenger AppThe passenger app helps you take advantage of some features not available on the driver app. For one, you can see where other drivers are, which helps you select areas without a lot of competition.For example, Guendelsberger was once at a stadium after a game and had a hard time getting any ride requests from the app.She logged into the passenger app and found herself surrounded by other drivers.So she simply drove to the other side of the stadium and quickly got a notification for a ride.She also found the passenger app to have more up-to-date information on surge fares than the driver app, which seemed to have a delay of a few minutes.https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/make-money/side-gigs/make-more-money-driving-for-uber/Read less..."

Uber and Lyft IPOs could mean the end of cheap rides,zaferian,13493,UberandLyftI,"Anyone who has studied game theory knows how this is going to go. They can't raise prices.

Uber and Lyft IPOs could mean the end of cheap rides,zaferian,13538,13533,"Basically what Rich said. If either side raises prices, they will lose, since all the business will go to the other one. But they also can't lower prices any more. This is due to a lot of factors, such as (obviously) their revenue, but also whether drivers will accept lower pay (no), how much of a loss investors are willing to bear, etc. So they are at a stable equilibrium point, which sounds ok, except that they are really stuck there.But, when I say it will take a major shake up to change this, a lot of people think the IPOs will be that catalyst. The pool of investors is suddenly blown up wide, and now the public has skin in the game and share prices are determined by a market. How much of a loss, if any, are  shareholders willing to accept? Well, both IPOs flopped, which I think says something.The next couple of years should be very interesting."

Uber and Lyft IPOs could mean the end of cheap rides,outlandish,13547,13497,"I'm not sure how far this can really extend though. All full time workers? I doubt it. Uber kind of hit a jackpot, by creating a gig worker economy out of skills that almost everyone has already (driving). But a lot of other full time jobs just won't fit into the gig worker economy. I wouldn't want to rely on whatever firefighters happen to be available when my house is burning down! And of course many higher skilled white collar jobs require a lot of training and rely heavily on tribal knowledge that can take years to build up. And, there is a lot of variance in the quality of employees. Companies want to keep the good ones, so they offer full time jobs with benefits. There is already the concept of contractors in white collar jobs, who are typically cheaper for a company than a full time employee. Yet most employees are still full time."

It is definitely difficult to determine what the surge percentage will be but I find it seems to work ok. If a rider requests a ride during a surge, you will get a miminum, fare amount, say $5. If it's a longer ride they apply a multplier, though I haven't figured out yet how that's calculated. Where it works really well though is after the surge. So let's say yo ugo through an are showing a $10 surge. You get no ride requests and the surge ends...however, on your next ride, you will get $10 added to your fare even if it's just a short trip.

In some cases, they do not need permission at all (assuming it is on their property or inside a private vehicle).  In some cases, they need explicit permission.  In some cases, this notification needs to be displayed inside and outside of the vehicle.  In some cases, the drivers can record up to 30 seconds beffore and after an accident/incident. etc. etc.""Reasonable expectation of privacy?""In general, people can be video recorded anywhere they do not have reasonable expectation of privacy.  A public roadway, inside taxis and buses, and inside people's properties are generally one of those places.Disclaimer: I am not a legal professional, and the comments above should not be taken as a legal advice.ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Apr 06, 2018"

I was praying she wasn't my ride as I was pulling up and when she started walking towards my car my heart sank. I didn't want a 20 minute ride with a girl crying uncontrollably. She got in, I kind of ignored her at first but then I asked if she was ok and she was literally cry-heaving in the backseat. She sputtered out that she just found out her dad had passed away. She started spilling everything and while it was a little hard to understand her through the tears I got the impression that the last time she talked with her dad they had gotten in a big fight. You could tell the guilt and remorse was just eating her up. I still think about her almost 2 years later. I hope she is doing alright."

However, there are so many drivers out there who accept every ping that they will not be stranded. As a driver coach, I teach to be selective, quality over quantity has always been my motto. It has proven to be a more successful strategy and more profitable. I set my rules for accepting pings that I think are the most beneficial for me."
My interview with Alex Cohen on Spectrum Channel One this week,EricH1973,16160,16149,"That’s fair and you should do what’s most beneficial to you. If some passengers get stranded, I think that’s the fault of the system, not the drivers.When we think back to the taxi days, they picked up every passengers, all drivers. I think the attitude was, “you win some and you lose some, it all works out in the end.”Only if Uber paid enough (meaning they paid outwaymore on the “win trips”) that model would work."

As a driver I definitely notice this.  I heard that this is due to their algorithm is not as advanced as Uber's, but I think it's less greed.You'd think I'd like Uber as a driver for more surges, but customers aren't stupid either."

"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",CasPer,Uberfarediff,0,Many are starting to claim that Uber is charging different prices for different people. People being charged completely different prices for the same exact ride and at virtually same time. Are we all being duped? How does Uber discriminate?Here's an examplehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMm4ehc7oCw
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.","ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLC",ippei1202Ube,Uberfarediff,"Check your GPS and remember that UberPool pricing is affected by demandUberPool is guaranteed pricing, so the user on the left indeed is looking to pay more than her friend.The most likely scenario is due to the nature of UberPool's pricing. In this video, two people are requesting similar routes sequentially. This naturally raises the demand for that route. This can impact the pricing/estimates.While UberPool's fare is based on duration and distance, the price will be adjusted by demand, i.e. instances of picking up other people.  In similar words, you are essentially given a discount for sharing a ride. Perhaps the user on the right is given more discount due to the more likely possibility of incurring delays due to picking up other users.Another possibility (albeit less likely) is that the two phones resolved two different routes, potentially due to the ever changing traffic factor and slightly different GPS locations picked up by each phone. Yes, the two phones are right next to each other, but devices' GPS can pick up slightly different locations. This can make a big difference, say, one user's pick up location being on the other side of the road and it ends up requiring a U-turn.ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Dec 05, 2016"
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",DDominico69,19699,Uberfarediff,"Did you see this?The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets"
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",MLG,1997,Uberfarediff,"This is a different topicSo, I go to Walmart from home.  After I am finished with Walmart, I go home.  It is the same distance to and from Walmart and the same route.  Why does Uber charge more for the ride home (sometimes twice the amount of the original ride)?  It is not my fault if driver 2 has to drive out of his way to reach me.  I should be charged the same amount."
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",srider78,1999,1997,"That started to happen with me recently.  I take uber to a shopping area (Framingham MA) for like 14 and on the way back, it's like 20 bucks now.I don't think it's the extra distance for drivers to pick me up.  I suspected it and asked my driver but he told me he didn't get any extra.  He thought it is most likely the surge because Framingham is a city and can get busy depending on where I am.So here's the thing.  Now they call it ""upfront pricing"" not ""surge"" anymore.  It's Uber's new way of quoting you whatever they want....whatever you are willing to pay. So apparently, they know I have to get home (and many people take it from that shopping area), so they can charge way higher.  It's pretty crappy in my opinion.  So, now I do the weird thing where I take Uber into town and then Tommy's Taxi to get home."
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",RelaxedRecliner,2062,1999,"Yep.  Upfront pricing.  It's a way for them to charge anything they want to with no justification or even explanation, e.g. surge.Now they have a monopoly on the market, they are going to be more bold on jacking up the prices.  Didn't we all suspect this a while back?  They came in with super low prices, and now it's time to raise the rates...and they will do it in the most inconspicous way possible."
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",cContino77,3483,2062,"See, to an untrained eye, ""upfront pricing"" means nothing.  No where on the app it says that you are getting an ""upfront pricing"" and it certainly does NOT compare upfront pricing to a ""regular pricing.""  Hence, it's all just whatever you are willing to pay.Some people ask whether it's illegal to change up the pricing and consistenyl deviate from the posted rates.  Well?  It is legal because they are quoting you the price in advance.  Yep, that is a ""quote""."
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",StuffinMuffin,877,Uberfarediff,"When I first saw this, there was a span of where I used my iPhone and iPad to get ratese, but they were always exactly the same so I stopped caring very quickly."

"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",SmittenKitten,926,878,"I wonder if the fact that you two were from different cities have anything to do with it.  Probably not.This is slightly unrelated but, recently, I have been seeing much higher rates for the same legs that I used to take.  I really think it's because of the upfront pricing. I think they are making up fares now instead of basing it on distance and duration.  Something smells fishy to me!"
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",babarett,2167,926,"Ya, same here! They claim their prices are lower but I remember getting into the city from my house for right around $20 and now it is always approaching $30...I have also heard the theory before that they exploit frequent riders, knowing they need the rides."
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",CasPer,1011,878,"The first request must have triggered the surge pricing for the second request (albeit a split second later).  You doubled the demand while the supply diminihed by one car, right?"
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",nazia.k.ali70,883,Uberfarediff,"It has nothing to do with GPS & surge pricing. Uber is plain and simple exploiting its frequent riders. I noticed this for the first time when the fare for a ride from the airport to the same location for me was double of what was displayed for my friend. I tried to test this out and made 3 of my friends at office put in the same pickup and drop off location. Middle of the afternoon, no surge pricing. Sure enough everyone got the exact same fare except for me. Mine was 30% higher. If this isn't proof, I don't know what is!!"
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",hanks1marc,2142,883,That is messed up and wrong for them to do their repeat customers that way. I am having the same thing happen to me with Lyft.
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",hanks1marc,2143,2142,"Also, I noticed that right before I request a ride with Lyft after I have typed in my pickup and destination address if I do not request the ride for a few minutes the fare price changes and is initially very high (expensive) but the longer I wait the lower it will get but eventually it starts going back up again, so I'm glad I did not request the ride at the first fare price because I would have paid triple price. What a GOUGE!"
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",CasPer,1010,883,My guess?  Maybe the first request (albeit it being only a few seconds ahead) triggered the surge pricing.
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",eshughes77,1791,883,Is this anything to do with the upfront pricing?  How Uber charges whatever they think they can charge?   Maybe it's a surge based on demand.  Maybe Uber knows you are wealthier than your friend so they decided to charge you more.I am serious.  This is a thing everyone is talking about.  Uber charges whatever people are willing to pay.
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",kitkat22,61,Uberfarediff,I have actually experienced something similar to this! One time I was ordering an Uber and standing right next to my friend who was also ordering an Uber and my app was showing a surge and hers was not!

"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",BethCloud,2061,Uberfarediff,"This is happening in Macon Georgia's well.  Now with Lyft is doing this as well.  My son takes Uber or Lyft  and this is happening all the time.  The distance is the same,  same times a day, just different prices. What a rip off!  I think I'm going to start using a cab company."
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",AmyJohannahSargent,3444,Uberfarediff,I just had the craziest experience.  I’m in DC ordering a ride for my son in Knoxville - fare is $174 - which is no way.  I entered the info again making sure it’s correct - it’s now $192!!  I ended up giving my son my credit card info (wanted to avoid that) and he was able to order the uber for $16.  What’s going on???
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",TonyAlmeida,3482,3444,"Wow.  10x your son's is just too much.  Perhaps Uber's algorithm broke and it took it to the extreme.  We all know now that they fluctuate the fare to reflect ""whatever you are willing to pay.""I am curious.  Do you often use Uber for business trips?  Have you accepted some unusually expensive rides recently?  Maybe Uber was challenging you to see how much you are willing to pay.I do seriously wonder if Uber profiles depending on your past history.  Is that really legal?"
"Uber fare different for same location, same route, same time, and no surge.",bBerman81,3554,3444,"Gasp!  The same thing happened to me once too, when I was on a business trip at Gaylord Hotel in DC.  My colleague and I both had the Uber app, and his showed like $15, and mine showed $88.  i thought it was a total fluke, perhaps a bug.  So I just had him call one.I'd love to provide more details to see what factors are involved but honestly, I am not sure how he and I were so different.  I am from Boston and he's fro Philly.  We were in DC together.  We both take Uber for work in downtowns and have similar riding habits."

There are exceptionsI assume you are referring to the return leg AFTER the passenger is dropped off.  These tolls are paid by the driver unless there is another customer on the return trip.  The passengers are not generally responsible for the bridge or tunnel tolls incurred while they are not in the vehicle.  (Some drivers requst or demand the customers to pay for the return trip as well, in cash, but this is not legitimate.)There are exceptions however.There are situations on certain bridges/tunnels, where the passenger must pay tolls for the return trip.  These exceptions seem to be set for trips thattake the driver out of his or her home territoryANDwhere there is no toll on the outbound trip but there is on the return.Great examples are:- Taking Bay Bridge from San Francisco to Oakland. This bridge has no toll on the outbound trip from San Francisco, but there is for the return.  In order for the driver to not get stuck footing the bill, only to return to his or her territory, the passenger pays for the toll.- Taking one of the four bridges from Philadelphia to New Jersey.  (Ben Franklin, Walt Whitman, Betsy Ross, and Commodore Barry bridges)  Tolls are incurred when traveling into Pennsylvania on these bridges; however, passengers who are traveling into New Jersey are charged tolls for the outbound trip.Related Articles:How do Uber Pool and Lyft Line handle tolls?

Uber experiments: Drivers seeing destination info before accepting the trip.,SteffGart24,Uberexperime,0,"Uber seems to be experimenting with a feature where they are starting to show rider destinations BEFORE the driver accepts the trip.  (For those of you who didn't know, driver usually cannot see the destination until he or she accepts.  This is to prevent the driver from cherry picking their rides.)You must have high enough acceptance rate and low cancellation fees.So I have not had this happen to me.  Does Uber contact you with this special privilege, or do I just start seeing them in the app?"
Uber experiments: Drivers seeing destination info before accepting the trip.,RPaulson,6555,Uberexperime,"I got an email from Uber about this. Unlike Uber who just starts random experiments without notifying anyone, they actually seem to be notifying the drivers.  I have a few buddies who also received the privilege as well.That is correct that you must have at least 85% Acceptance Rate and below 5% Cancellation Rate.It seems to be for every ride.  It's wonderful."
Uber experiments: Drivers seeing destination info before accepting the trip.,CWalcutt75,6556,6555,That is awesome.  Where are you from?
Uber experiments: Drivers seeing destination info before accepting the trip.,RPaulson,6558,6556,"New Jersey.It's definitely not all drivers though.  I have a friend who has high enough acceptance rate and low enough cancellation, but he never got the invitation.So it must be a slow roll out."
Uber experiments: Drivers seeing destination info before accepting the trip.,LCarpenter,6559,Uberexperime,"This actually makes sense, doesn't it?  As long as the driver is good about accepteing rides, there shouldn't be a problem about sharing this information.  If the driver is cherry picking the requests, the acceptance rate will naturally fall below the threshold.Genius."
Uber experiments: Drivers seeing destination info before accepting the trip.,DaimsLer,6561,6559,"yeah, it does make sense.and it is helpful to know the destination so you can plan your trips and the overall direction you are going"
Uber experiments: Drivers seeing destination info before accepting the trip.,KristenJanetKim,6632,Uberexperime,"If you want rides where you see your destination and how much you will make before you accept, you need to drive for a kid rideshare company. Unfortunately it’s not for everyone. If you live in the San Francisco Bay Area, you have 3 companies, HopSkipDrive, Kango and Zūm. In the L.A. area, you have HopSkipDrive and Zūm. If you’re in Denver, HopSkipDrive just launched there. I don’t know about any other areas. You also have to have experience working with children, and most of the drivers are women, since many parents don’t want men picking up their kids. You also have to be fingerprinted. The greatest advantages of the kid rideshare companies are higher pay rates ($16 minimum for HopSkipDrive and Zūm, and $20 for Kango), and the peak periods are after school, when Uber and Lyft are typically slow. There are fewer evening rides and even fewer weekend rides. So I drive kids on weekdays and Uber/Lyft on weekends."
Uber experiments: Drivers seeing destination info before accepting the trip.,PattyMelt,13229,6632,You don’t actually get to pick the race or gender of somebody you are hiring or contracting. That’s very illegal and unethical.
Uber experiments: Drivers seeing destination info before accepting the trip.,TonyAlmeida,6562,Uberexperime,"This is a good idea.  Drivers were cherry picking anyways before, right?  The drivers can just accept the ride, see the destination, and then cancel the trip if it isn't a good one.  It wasted everyone's time.  Drivers knew they have a number of cancellations they are allowed to take (set forth by themselves).  So, just make it so they can see the destination, and let them decide which rides they will take a hit on their ""Acceptance Rate."""
Uber experiments: Drivers seeing destination info before accepting the trip.,SmittenKitten,6563,6562,"Right.  They basically swapped the Cancellation Rates and Acceptance Rates on what gets impacted when the driver ""cherry picks."""

We are people with plans, you know. No more fumbling with trip preference and ""on the way home"" features.   Let us decide for ourselves.We have all been there. At the end of a shift, or when you feel like making a few bucks because of a downtime, you want to go online but aren't sure you would end up on the other side of town. This solves that's and it'll make me work more for sure."
Uber experiments: Drivers seeing destination info before accepting the trip.,AsStibelDude,6564,Uberexperime,I got an email from Uber but it only spoke to the acceptance rate.  Nothing about cancellation fees.and I think it said the threshold is 80%.  Not 85.
Uber experiments: Drivers seeing destination info before accepting the trip.,Bigfrank,13854,Uberexperime,this is why I don't drive in the extreme rush hour because I don't want to get screwed by some passenger that's going to get me stuck in traffic. this is one of the major reasons why there's a high turnover rate ride sharing apps

Uber experiments: Drivers seeing destination info before accepting the trip.,bBerman81,6599,Uberexperime,"I've never driven an Uber but there's a reason we need mechanism to stop drivers from cherry picking, right? It's even illegal for taxi drivers.Here's an example, in Boston, drivers hate picking up passenger who are trying to go to East Boston across the harbor. It has traffic, long tunnel or bridge, and it is difficult to pick up another coming back. Not to mention tolls on the way back.  They despise it to the point they ask the passenger straight out.  Then passengers also know the game so they lie.If Uber drivers knew in advance you are going to East Boston, I have a feeling the residents there would have a difficulty in finding a ride. That didn't seem fair"
Uber experiments: Drivers seeing destination info before accepting the trip.,RedANT,6603,6599,"Just my opinion, but forcing a driver to take you somewhere that costs them money doesn't seem very fair either, does it?  A driver will eventually accept your request, it just may take a bit of patience and time.Would you spend your afternoon driving someone to an undesireable location, paying for gas, losing money and not spending time with your family, and all for someone that most likely wouldn't even tip you for your time or efforts?  Yeah, neither would we."

Uber experiments: Drivers seeing destination info before accepting the trip.,RedANT,6604,6600,"In that case, Uber should pay their drivers a fair wage so that this isn't an issue.  Passengers always complain about their bottom line, but dare not ever do anything to stop Ubers unethical practices.  Want awesome service?  Demand Uber pay their drivers to provide it.  (And not at the drivers expense)"

First, yes I drive to make money. When I drive I try to accommodate everyone and make their trip as pleasant as possible. I try to be as helpful as possible with bags, stopping at a store, mac machine etc. When weather is bad i try to pull as close to their front door, driveway, etc. I open door from inside so they just have to jump in.  I am sure other drivers do the same. What I am trying to get at is some drivers (not all) try to do the best job they can, accomodate riders as much as possible. We could just be polite, drive from point A to B and do nothing extra at all but still make the same amt of $ as the driver metioned above (that may do something extra). When you are headed out in awful, dangerous weather please consider TIPPING YOUR DRIVER. Do you have any idea the risk they take in this weather? Not only do they want to go home at the end of their shift with their car not damaged they sure as hell dont want you to be  injured or worse killed. Some of us drivers out there although doing it for the $ may also drive longer hrs in bad weather knowing its difficult and demand is high to get people home. Trust me $ isnt the only thing that keeps drivers out in bad weather because you dont make more money when roads are bad. Traffic is backed up and trips take much more time but pay doesnt increase much at all (example  for a trip that takes 10 min in normal weather but took driver 47 min in snow pd 2.47 extra). I'll say it AGAIN PLEASE TIP your driver especially in BAD WEATHER and if they DO MORE than get you safely from point A to point B ( carry bags, make stops, drop a friend 2 blocks over, pick your drunk ass up out of the street & help you to your door).  It's just the right thing to do.Read less..."

I was shocked when I read it in driving manual. Front seat passenger and driver must wear a seatbelt.  It takes less than 10 secs to buckle up. It's better  to lose 10 secs of time than being ejected out of the car. If your in front seat your head goes through that windshield your going to get messed up or worse. Me ex went through windshield no seatbelt. Half his face was hanging off. It was awful. These passengers dont know what kind of driver we are. They know nothing about us. Then factor in bad weather, bad visibility, wind, flooded roads, and bad drivers on the road why wouldn't you put a seatbelt on. I have people get annoyed with me when I ask them to put it on. I just dont get it."

Snow is much worse as traffic gets really bad. Last storm we had I did 2 rides both shouldve been 5 to 7 min pick ups. I spent 59 min extra picking these 2 riders up which I was pd 1.97 for 26 min. and 2.45 for 47 min. My 1st riders work was closed when we arrived she had no where to go until a family member came. I stayed with her for 30 min until family member got there (Uber didnt  force me to do it but I felt it was the right to do). She did tip 6.50. Next rider got 4 blocks from his house when his work cancelled. No tip. Yes we are out there to make money. Sometimes just the little extras you do or the risk you take would be nice to receive even a $2/ $3 tip as I know these rides can be costly if there is a surge.Thank you for understanding my point:)"

I now have a booster so if child is over 6 yrs of age and 40lbs I will take them as long as they go in seat.

It’s a classic example of some rich [expletive] being an [expletive].” He offered several other descriptive adjectives, all of which are accurate and none of which are printable.I think the real workings here (and why this dude or girl park there) is because $120 ticket and/or $150 towing fees will not really impact people who can afford a $250K car."

Uber rang in its IPO with champagne and mimosas. Then the hangover began.,chawes,Uberranginit,0,"You just can't teach an old dog new tricks, can you.SAN FRANCISCO — Uber shut down a party at a satellite California office and at least one employee resigned after some celebrations marking its initial public offering last week got out of hand, according to current and former employees, a setback for the company’s efforts to change its corporate culture.Those people said that the celebrations, which kicked off with company-provided mimosas on the day of one of the largest public offerings in recent history, made them feel uncomfortable and seemed immature — especially as Uber’s stock price plunged, erasing billions of dollars of value. It also reminded some of a more toxic company culture Uber has been striving to erase, causing something of a hangover.“Old Uber hid themselves until today apparently,” said one employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because that person was not authorized to speak publicly.https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/17/uber-rang-its-ipo-with-champagne-mimosas-then-hangover-began/?utm_term=.5fcaf5282268"

Leaders within companies like to think they can change things, but really they're just role players within the system, and that the system essentially runs on its own. Changing a company culture is incredibly difficult. I'm not surprised to hear that the fraternity culture never left Uber."

You should ask a driver to slow down if they are driving at high rates of speed or erratically. If they dont slow down again ask them to pull over in a safe place. If they refuse and you are in a safe place cancel the trip they will pull over then trust me. Anytime you feel uncomfortable or feel something isnt right trust your instincts. Better to be safe then sorry. There are safety features in your app to contact 911 also.Read less..."

Maybe report it to Uber so you get a refund."

If driver is doing speed limit you cant really expect them to slow down. Remember many drivers have experience, know how to be safe on road, drive at their comfortable pace (hopefully doing the speed limit)if that is the case leave them go. You want your driver to be comfortable also as he or she are operating the vehicle. But if speeding just say, Please slow down.  Usually works unless they are not speeding.

I got into an accident and my passenger is claiming they can sue me. Is that true?,Jaredhoffa,Igotintoanac,0,"Here's the scenario:You have a passenger in your car. A few minutes later you're sitting at a stop light and BOOM, you get rear-ended and the passenger gets thrown forward. A few seconds later, he holds his neck and screams, “Look what you did! You’re going to pay for this!”So, the question becomes,what’s the personal liability here? Is there really any chance this guy can go after their Uber/Lyft driver?Short answer: Very unlikely. Since you’re online with Uber/Lyft, they have a $1M deductible, and with your own insurance the chances of them needing more than $1M+ are slim to none. Regardless of your fault or not.  In this case, the at-fault driver’s insurance is “primary.” That means his insurance company will have to pay first for any claims made in relation to the crash.Let’s switch up the facts.Let's say you (the Uber/Lyft driver) caused the crash and rear-ended another driver. The passenger is hurt and threatens to sue.In actuality, not much changes. Because the Uber/Lyft driver is the at-fault driver, their insurance is “primary.” They're still in period three, meaning Uber/Lyft’s company takes over. That insurance will cover damages up to its limits (again, $1 million). As such, there’s plenty of coverage and they need not worry about their assets in most scenarios.The bottom line:After a crash, stay calm, call the police to investigate and report the incident to Uber/Lyft.LegalRidesharedeals with these incidents everyday, so don't hesitate to call."

Uber driver who jumped in front of train was deeply in debt,momof4,Uberdriverwh,0,"Not only are taxi cab drivers in New York commiting suicide now Uber driver. Edit: Jumped in front of a train a block from his home. So sad. Unfortunately people see in ads all over on social media, youtube, etc... that you can make all this money driving for Uber/Lyft. People out there believe it. Yes there are the negative stories or people saying you cant make the money but some people still think that it can be done. Be your own boss, make your own hours, promotions, bonuses. The American Dream. Then you get out on the road drive 10 min. to a pick up to drive that person a mile up the road for 3.00. You may know the old saying ""sounds too good to be true it probably is"". There are people out there that believe what Uber/Lyft tell you. There are drivers out there that make money, get the bonuses, etc... its just not for everybody. Also depending on where you drive affects how much you make. Most cities are saturated with drivers. I can see a difference in the 18mths I've been driving. Lot less money this year compared to last.

There are plenty of investment bankers who make a lot but deeply in debt and end up committing suicide. We don't raise that in an article saying that their job didn't pay enough."

Uber doesn't care about their drivers or what means they use to get people to drive.   I now learned a big lesson.

I delivered UberEats for nearly a year. Most of the time, if you factor in my expenses and time, I made less than minimum wage. The only time I did better was when people tipped. Which was less than half the time.One time I accepted a request that turned out to be nearly a half hour away (mostly freeway). When I arrived, it was a McDonalds, and a man who lived a mile away had ordered a Big Mac, fries and a soda. And of course, no tip. I think I made $3.50 on the delivery. And then I had to drive back. An hour of my time, probably $8 in gas, and $3.50 was what I had to show for it. It was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.And I won't even mention the dozens of times I had to wait 15 or 20 minutes at a restaurant while they were preparing an order. And of course I wasn't paid for that time.No longer. If you're thinking about driving Uber Eats, think again."

I do have a white car so maybe it doesn’t show as much but do you think it affects tipping or customer impression?I do work harder to keep the interior clean, and that’s a whole another challenge.I used to have a place that’d let me use their vacuum for free if you were a Uber driver.

The top-level points:Uber drivers don’t know how much they earn (or lose)Regulators and researchers lack information on driver work conditions33% of Uber drivers took on debt relating to the job30% of drivers reported physical assaults or safety concernsAnd yet, 50% of drivers would recommend it to a friend, and 45% planned to continue for at least six monthsUber’s take rate on rides improved to 21% in 2017 from 16% in 2016 “as a result of declining Driver incentives,” the company saidin its S-1. It ticked up again, to 22% in 2018, on “increases to booking fees in select markets.”In other words, Uber’s fare games have helped it improve margins, often at the expense of drivers. From the Georgetown report:Of the 40 drivers in this study, 83% knew what percentage of their fares Uber took but 38% did not know how Uber determined the amount drivers took home on a single fare (whether, for instance, the booking fee is removed before or after Uber takes its commission), whether they were required to buy commercial insurance, or how tax filing worked at the end of the year. This varying degree of knowledge about compensation details could have been expected if the majority of drivers in our study were new to the Uber platform. But they were not. Seventy percent of the drivers in this study had worked on the Uber platform for at least seven months.I linked to the PDF source in the link above.https://oversharing.substack.com/p/some-uber-drivers-still-dont-know"

Lyft with Express worth it?,Trees73Fu,LyftwithExpr,0,"Hi people! I just joined because I'm thinking of doing Lyft through the Express Hertz program in Portland, since I don't have a car. I hear the rental fees are waived when you complete 75 rides in a week. Who else has done it? Is there anything else I should know before starting? And approximately how many hours would it take to make 75 trips a week? (I know it depends on a bunch of factors, just want a ballpark figure)."

Lyft with Express worth it?,Trees73Fu,8512,8478,thank you!
Lyft with Express worth it?,BGraft89,8479,LyftwithExpr,"75 will be at least 4 days, and that's if you are very good and know what you are doing.  They are looking for drivers who are willing to go out there every day, pretty much.Here's my warning to you.  You will really need to comit, and that's the lifestyle you will be committing to.  It's fine if you are ready, but remember that one of the benefits of driving an Uber is flexibility and working when you want to.  This Express program basically takes that freedom away.I always suggest to my friends to ease into driving for Uber or Lyft.  Try it out for a few hours at a time.   See how it will work for you. 75 times is jumping in with both feet.  Many drivers end up burning out when driving for too many hours"
Lyft with Express worth it?,BrianTheScrewDriver,8506,LyftwithExpr,"You will be stuck doing lots of small trips, and remember us drivers HATE doing that. With the 75 rides looming, you will choose to work in cities where the trips are shorter. Then you end up paying a much bigger chunk of your fare because of the booking/service fee.  People also tip very little on those shorter rides.Where you make the most money is those longer drives. That's where the money is, say trips from the airport to a town 45 minutes away.  Those weekend travelers, for example.  Short trips are the people going 4 minutes from their house to work because it is raining and they didn't want to take the bus. Yuck.This is Uber's ploy to get a group of drivers who are willing to cover those short rides.  There you have it."
Lyft with Express worth it?,AsStibelDude,8711,LyftwithExpr,"I feel it's another way Uber/Lyft is trying to confuse us in order to make more money.I did this in Boston a few years back.  Remember the pressure of accepting 90% of requests in order to qualify.  Imagine getting pings for 20~30 minutes away, and you are FORCED to accept them.Also, when I did it, you needed certain number of prime time hour driving, which adds to the stress.  I believe the program is still very much the same.Having your own car is well worth it though.  It was nice having a much newer car and being able to use it for personal use."
Lyft with Express worth it?,ippei,8507,LyftwithExpr,Great discussions going on here.  All great advice.   Here are some relevant articles from RideGuruGetaround: Is Renting A Car For $5 an Hour to Drive for Uber Worth It?What about peer-to-peer car rentals?Uber Rent - Drive stranger's cars AirBnB style! Would you rent your car for $5 an hour?
Lyft with Express worth it?,EjiEzeEze,8480,LyftwithExpr,"75 trips?  It's pretty much a fulltime job.  Expect to drive AT THE LEAST 40 hours, but probably more.  50~ hours?See, it depends.  Some parts of the week are busier than others. (say weekends) Some parts of the day are slower than others. (say mid morning or mid-afternoon)   So if you carefully choose the hours you work, I bet you can get 75 rides in 25~30 hours.  However, you will most likely be on the road and ""working"" more than that between those busier parts.Imagine.  If you work the 7:00~9:00AM, then 12:00~1:30, and then 5:30~7:00.  Those are busy times...what's that, 5 hours?   I bet you can get 4~5 rides an hour in a city with many short trips.  The catch?  Whatcha gonna do between those windows? You will be waiting around through those slower times. :)So in short, to get 75 trips within a week, you are looking at a fulltime job, where you will be on the road at least 5 days a week.  At least that's my opinion."

Lyft with Express worth it?,StuffinMuffin,8485,LyftwithExpr,"I drive only on Friday and Saturday nights, and I can get about 20~30 rides in those short hours.   Remember those are the busy times though.Do you know what else?  You can make majority of your weekly earnings on just those days. It can equate to earnings for the rest of the week combined.  (in other words, you can make half your earning on Friday and Saturday)The thing about these plans is that you won't be able to do that."
Lyft with Express worth it?,CWalcutt75,8482,LyftwithExpr,"Commitment for a fulltime gig is often hard for a Lyft driver, and you will sacrifice flexibility with this. If you go with renting,you will lose some plays in the Lyft driver playbook.There are lots of styles of play in Uber and Lyft driving.Only driving the weekends.  Drive 8 hours Friday night and 8 hours Saturday night, and you can make as much as a driver who drove all weekdays.  It's that lucrative and some people only work those hours.Let's say you have to drop off a friend at the airport an hour away.  You are wasting gas on the way back.  but with Uber?  You may be able to get a fare on the way back.BTW, I have gotten 50 rides driving only weekends.  not sure if you can get 75.  I doubt it.  On the flipside, I think I can definitely say you are giving up one of your weekends unless you are good right out of the gate."

She apologized profusely and asked what to do.  I said there isn't much i can do, so I drove her across the street.  Even if either of us cancelled, she would have been charged the minimum, so..This seems to happen every few months for me.  Maybe every 500 rides or so?"

Can I request a female Uber driver? (I'm female and would feel more safe),lacy,7275,7244,"It sounds like a PR campaign. I went to their site and found out more. It does require an in-person interview and a more thorough background check. But I also note when I look through the pictures that I do not see any diversity. This is one thing that Lyft and Uber do have due to their onboarding process. While a more thorough background check might make some feel more comfortable, in reading about most horror stories, there was no history of inappropriate behaviors, so no matter how thorough that check is, these people would have still slid in. The problem with those background checks is that they cost a lot of money and certainly that cost would be put onto the customer. I also noticed there was no fare estimator, which leads me to believe that they would be much higher than either Lyft or Uber."

All it took was an email or 2, 4 days later (it was a holiday weekend) I had fully charged mic that was light weight. Hooked it up with 1 wire (to car stereo or bluetooth speaker). Made an extra $27.00! What does a driver have to loose? Try it on 1 ride you dont like it give it to your kids. I only do bar trips in the summer and Oct, Nov, Dec & holidays. If it brings in a few extra bucks great if not I had fun with my riders."

"Rideshare Drivers interested in having some fun with the riders & getting bigger tips check this out. It's free for drivers. TOTALLY FREE, NO Shipping $0",momof4,17186,17157,Yes they do send it for free no catch. Its free advertising for them. They even sent me something to throw over the seat with info on how to purchase one with little papers for riders to take with my code on it. If a rider buys one I get 10.00 if they use my code. It can get loud but when you have a bunch of drunk people its loud anyway. Better when they are singing then all of them talking asking me questions:) Trying to answer 3 to 7 people all talking at once is more difficult. They sing I drive. Keeps them occupied. Its like giving a kid a new toy:) Ill post the info in next 24 hrs if anyone is interested.

Be nice if Uber follows!",momof4,"Hawaii,Boise",0,"Lyft is now testing paying drivers once we swipe accept. Boise, Rozwell, Hawaii are the areas this rolls out in on June 27th. Once the driver swipes ACCEPT the driver gets .45 then every min it takes you to get to the rider you will be paid .25 per min. & .57 per mile. Once you arrive and start trip ypu will get your regular rates. Will Lyft roll this out in every city? If so when?  Will Uber follow? What are your thoughts?Update:After seeing post by RedAnt and looking into this further this may not be a good thing. What Lyft failed to mention is they cut rates first. As of now in the 6 markets this was rolled out to it seems like you may make better money for linger pick up but not on shorter ones. We will have to wait and see after getting feedback from drivers in those areas. RedAnt has a post to this thread that explains it more."

Looks like I’m mostly going to be driving Uber now... I’m disappointed in lyft. They cut our rates from $1.125 a mile to $.57 a mile. No way the increase per minute ($.165 to $.255) will make up for that. $.09 increase? Really lyft? I’d rather take the extra $.55 a mile. I’m not happy.

"Hawaii, Boise, Rozwell Drivers, Lyft is going to pay you once you swipe accept. Hopefully will hit all markets soon. Be nice if Uber follows!",momof4,14301,14276,Sounds like it. On Uber there is a threshold in each market. My market is 10 min. If I get a long pick up 20 min away in certain areas & its a long trip I will take it. I will make approx. $10 to go get them on top of the fare of the long trip. I am getting mixed answers on them paying while picking up the passenger. It seems they are lowering rates then adding the adding the additional  fare for the pick up. This is causing a loss for the driver. Funny how they make it seem like they are doing something good for the driver but just pushing the knife in further. See RedAnts post above. I am going to watch a You Tube video to see what he figured out. Ill report back after viewing it.

Be nice if Uber follows!",Bspringz,14377,"Hawaii,Boise","I am a lyft driver in Honolulu, one of the test cities for the new rate system. It was launched yesterday and after my first night driving with the new rates, I am not a fan. Lyft made it seem like this was such a great thing for drivers, but it was just a way for them to hide a pay cut from us. Some rides, yes, you make more money, but I’d say 80% of rides you actually make less money. Only if you are sitting in traffic or if it is a long pick up (most rides aren’t) you make more money. I drove for 6 hours and I should have made at least $150 with the old rates. Instead I made $125. Here are the old rates vs. the new  rates.That is a full $.55 less per mile!!! I am not happy."

They put info out to drivers in other markets about getting paid once you swipe accept but never mentioned they were reducing anything. If it wasnt for the drivers they wouldnt have a company. It sucks. Hopefully CA drivers will do the right thing and force these companies to at the very least increase fares. Not holding my breath. Hang in there. Maybe they will get whats coming to them.

Thousands of ride share drivers’ certifications revoked or suspended,momof4,Thousandsofr,0,Maybe if they would get rid of the criminals and sex offenders they would't have as many lawsuits or bad press. It would open up more trips to deserving drivers that are not criminals or sex offenders.  That are out there trying to make a living. I have a 21 yr old daughter that thankfully dont Uber much and when she does its with a group of friends or her boyfriend.

Thousands of ride share drivers’ certifications revoked or suspended,momof4,10568,10566,"Sounds like a plan. I agree especially with bzckground checks. Fingerprinted FBI check is under 50.00,. I want to say 35/40. Its easy and a few places in area are licensed to do. Results come back very fast. In some cases instantly. The only issue I see with car seats is fhe age of child. My kids are in their teens and 20's but if I remember correctly there are 3 stages of car seats. It would be tough to keep multiple car seats in our our cars. Maybe they make one seat that converts and can be used for different stages. The other issue is if we lend a carseat to rider and that particular car seat had recall we would be responsible if something happened. I got that info on amother post hete on the site. I do however carry a bosster seat (age 6 and over) it cost me 13.00. Easy to store in trunk, dont take up much room, light weight. Since its only a booster not a protective seat no issue with liability. It pd for itself in one ride. Now no need to decline rides if kids are 6 yrs old & up."

Would love to hear other riders bad experiences with cars being dirty, messy, or just bad looking. RIDERS - Please share if you have had a bad driver or messy, banged up carLG PA, Wes, or any other driver that drives in Philly or Lower Bucks County. Have a question maybe one of you can please help me with.  I stayed out of city last night and drove as far as Ambler but was generally around Southampton & surrounding area for rest of night. I had all short trips 6XL, 1 Pool, and 13X. Four trips ranged from 3.50 to 7.00, 3 trips 7.00 to 10.00. Thirteen trips which were surged or XL 10.00 to 20.00. Just need 4 trips for 1 quest & 14 for other which I will be able to do. Trip miles 157. Gas approx. 27.00. Much better gas mileage up there than in the city. Had I been in the city I would've used more gas & drove a lot more miles & less trips. When I drive in the city I decline more trips if in bad neighborhoods or in CC. Lots of dead miles heading out of those areas to get to better areas. Obviously last night was busy and not the norm. If I were to drive in those areas on regular weekends is it possible to make 125.00 to 200.00 from 6pm and 3am. on a Saturday night? Have any of you driven Sunday 5am to 2pm? Is it worth it? How are Friday nights in that area? Just curious as I would love to drive weekends up there and weekdays down here. I know its not always possible to stay in one certain area all the time. Things can change day to day etc... I am trying to figure out a better more efficient way to drive (doesnt everyone):) I have the time to try different strategies but cant afford to lose a lot of $ doing so as I have some nice tuition payments to come up with lol. Starting in July I head back to finish Nursing School until June 2020. I will only be driving 1/2 days on weekends when in school. I need to have a plan by then where I can make most money in short amt of time/days (dont we all):). Classes, clinicals, studying takes most of my time.  Some weekends cant work at all.  Unfortunately I have to pay most of my tuition for my last year and starting to worry. Thought I would save this year but as we all know pay isnt as good and trips are down. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I dont expect you to tell me all your secrets, give away all the best spots, etc... Basically an answer of yes give it a try or no so not worth your time would be greatly appreciated. Would be great if every weekend was like last night. Headed to try out Philly airport Friday night. Ill post my experience. Following weekend may try Trenton on Friday night. Is Trenton an ok neighborhood?Read less..."
"Any drivers have any stories, issues, complaints about driving last night (night before Thanksgiving)?",LG-PA,10418,Anydriversha,"In Southampton (where I live) it is typically slow during regular weekends, though I see it lit up occasionally at night (Friday and Saturday night bar hours), I avoid driving at that time of the night.While you may get a few short bar hops in this area and in or around Warminster (by Walmart) these rides tend to be short and generally unprofitable, again unless you are chasing surges at crazy hours of the night.These towns are not heavily populated so rides are further spaced.By your 2nd or 3rd ride you will see you are gravitating further and further soutts (first towards Willow Grove, then Cheltenham, then you are back in the area of Broad and eventually Center City), I certainly would not make it a point to rush empty back from Center City to Warminster/Southampton in hopes of scoring your next big ride :)I created a temporary email address where you can email your telephone number if you want, will be glad to chat with you, as I am a very slow typer[email protected]"

I just got him there as quick as possible. I normally drive fast when I am not driving with people in my car. The road I had to take was major highway that I take often with no traffic no police around. I knew rider was upset and anxious just thought it was best for all of us to get there asap.

Typical is around $20/hr, usually over than under. This summer (tourist season) it's an average of $22-$28 hr over an 8-10 hour shift. Worst possible week is Christmas to New Years Eve - take it off except for the holidays themselves. Also, low income when the weather is nice and 65-75 degrees here. Best income hours are 10pm-1am any day. Not looking forward to this years Fall slowdown, if consistently under $20/hour then I'm probably out."

what is with the starting my trip before you are even on my street ?,RobynBradleyWallen,whatiswithth,0,This seems to be happening a lot here suddeenly.   It amazes me how one person gets an idea on how to scam  passengers and then other people follow along.  Now almost all of our Lyft drivers start the trip before we have even gotten in the car.  The other day he was a block away and had not even turned on our street.   REALLY?  Um we know when the trip is started and while I always tip if you are going to build in your own little tip you are probably going to get a lot less than what I would have given you.  To top it off the other day a driver not only started the trip early but ended it five minutes after I was inside the building.  SURPRIZE BUDDY-You screwed yourself becaus not only did I not tip you but called Lyft to have $4 refunded.  You would have at least gotten a tip from me plus the entire cost of the trip if you had some integreity.
what is with the starting my trip before you are even on my street ?,"ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLC",ippei1202Ube,whatiswithth,"Quick review of Uber and Lyft Driver apps - How pickup works.I can't comment on why these drivers are doing this, but I can shed some light on how the pickups work from the drivers' perspective.Arrival:Upon arrival at the pickup location, with the Lyft app the driver must tap on ""Arrive"" and then ""Confirm arrival.""  This sends a message to the rider that the driver has arrived.   If the app indicates that your driver has arrived before the car is at your location, you are right; perhaps the driver has tapped on the button prematurely.Caution:It is worth noting that with the Uber Driver App, this arrival is triggered automatically.  When the driver gets close to the pickup location, the app sends the message to the rider immediately.  This may seem to the rider as if the driver indicated an arrival too soon.Starting a Ride:Once the rider is in the vehicle, the driver can click on ""Pick up <name>"" (for Lyft) and ""Start Trip"" (for Uber).  This effectively starts the ride.  There is one important caveat however.  If the driver starts to drive, the driver app will automatically start the trip.Caution:This sometimes can happen inadvertently (i.e. the trip starts early) if the driver has a difficult time finding the rider.  I thought this was relevant in your case, if you had noticed that your driver was starting the trip too soon.Dropping off the passengerDropping off is definitely a manual step, in a way that the driver has to tap (for Lyft) or swipe (for Uber) to complete the ride.  Yes, a long-hauling scam can happen, where the driver would not complete a trip and continue to drive in hopes of passenger not realizing later and getting paid an increased fare. (Check out this article:After dropping off the passenger, can the Uber driver keep driving without completing the ride? ...in order ""to run up the meter?"")Caution: If the driver's phone does not have an Internet signal or its battery is dead, the driver would not be able to complete the trip. The trip will be completed once the driver is back in the range of the signal or the phone is recharged. (Relevant article:Can the driver complete and end the ride if he has no cell phone signal?)Closing RemarkIn any case, I believe you are doing the right thing by reporting these infractions to Lyft and getting a refund. Many of these scams are attempted by the drivers, and while the GPS and record keeping of Lyft make it easy to dispute these attempts, they often do go unnoticed and end up working in the drivers' favor.  (Taking Lyft tand Uber is almost too easy that riders often do not check the receipt or review the charges.)Lastly, here's one more article that may be relevant ot you:Can a Uber driver start the trip without the passenger in the car? ...and take an imaginary passenger for a ride to make money?ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Jul 31, 2018"
what is with the starting my trip before you are even on my street ?,ShadyPeteMD,6381,whatiswithth,"With Lyft, I have to confirm my arrival.  I do do that the moment I have ""arrived"" at the marker and where I have been asked.  In many cases, I would have to move the car again to actually do the pickup.  This usually isn't a problem because there is another step I need to do before I actually ""start"" a trip. i.e. perform a pickup.The clock or ""waiting"" does start as soon as the driver is near you.  That does go against the wait time.  2 minutes for Uber.  I can't remember for Lyft.  This isn't anything we can avoid. It's all automatic.I have inadvertently started trips, because the app thinks that I have.  There is a decently high threshold for a driver app for the trip to start automatically, but it does happen when we had to circle the block or whatever.  I think Uber and Lyft both do this now, and it's because many drivers were forgetting to start a trip and losing out on fares."
what is with the starting my trip before you are even on my street ?,RedANT,6371,whatiswithth,"When you say that they're starting the trip before getting to your location, how are you verifying their location?  With Lyft the driver starts the trip after they input that they ""arrived"" at your location, and the system will question them if they're not showing nearby.More often than not I ""arrive"" at a location, however the timer counts down even if I need to circle the block because you're requesting a pickup in a no-stopping area, bus lane or other hazardous location.  If you're in a downtown area, the pickup timer can certainly time out before they return, and the driver may be starting the ride rather than cancel on you.Despite speculation, the easiest way to find your answer is to directly question your driver."

I am pretty darn sure that it was the driver who just didn't want me as a rider.I spoke to a few people about this, and at first I thought maybe he didn't like me based on some visual queues.  However, they all thought if that was the case, he could have canceled the ride (and maybe even seek for a no show, if he is unethical.)Then it dawned on me.

At least for Uber and Lyft but...There are no fees for scheduling Uber and Lyft rides in advance.  By default, the fares are supposed to be the same, as ""scheduling"" a ride essentially just schedules the outbound requests to the drivers to a time you specify.  The fares are supposed to be calculated the same as any other ride.With that said, Uber and Lyft have different policies on handling the potential surge pricing that may be applied to the trip.Uber fare on Scheduled Rides: Uber will display the regular fare at the time of scheduling the ride.  This may be a standard estimate or an upfront pricing.  However, when the time of the ride comes, if there is a surge for the trip you are about to take, the surge will be applied.  Uber allows you to schedule up to 30 days in advance.Lyft fare on Scheduled Rides: When scheduling a ride with Lyft, Lyft will attempt to estimate the potential surge and display the fare that incorporates the increased fare.  So, Lyft basically quotes you a fare and guarantees the fare at the time of the scheduling.If you saw an increased fare for when you were about to schedule or ""reserve"" a ride, you may have been using Lyft.Does booking in advance or scheduling ahead guarantee my fare on Uber and Lyft?ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Jul 11, 2018"

Drivers who smoke. What special things do you do to make sure you don't get dinged on your ratings?,momof4,7294,Driverswhosm,I actually have the answer for you smokers out there. I  can smoke in my car right before I pick up a rider and they don't know it. I've tested it. I've checked with my riders that smoke. I've tested it with people that don't smoke. My rating is a 4.93 currently. Never received a complaint from passenger or Uber. The spray I use is called Blunt Effects. I buy it in smoke shops or gas stations 2.50 to 3.50 a bottle. There has to be over 50 scents or more. Some are stronger than others some last longer than others. So with that being said be careful one or two sprays at most. If you are headed to a 5 min pickup and you spray it open windows 3 min after you spray it right before your pick up rider. It is greasy and can ruin things.  Do not spray directly on anything you don't want ruined. I bought decent looking cheap car mats that's what I spray it on. I get compliments from over half my riders per night how great my car smells. It's great in bathrooms also.

Drivers who smoke. What special things do you do to make sure you don't get dinged on your ratings?,momof4,7410,7209,Read comments above for more info.  There is a spray called Blunt Effects. I smoke in my car. This spray will take the any and all bad smell out. Never had a complaint no one ever complained out if 1200 plus rides. Over half my riders per night gets in and says how great my car smells. It's not expensive just have to be careful what you spray it on as it is greasy. Another thing that helps is changing your cabin filter most cars have them inside car. YouTube your car video shows you where it is and how to change it.

Drivers who smoke. What special things do you do to make sure you don't get dinged on your ratings?,WendyC,7505,Driverswhosm,"I use ozium and have not had any complaints. In fact, my riders will get in my car and rave about how good it smells! It covers up ALL smells too. I also roll both windows down for a few minutes right after I smoke but before spraying Ozium. And it doesn’t take much. One spray per seat is what I do! And again, my riders LOVE it. I also use a lemon body spray for my clothes and hair and hand sanitizer for my hands. It also doesn’t hurt to wear something over your clothes while smoking either. If I stop to smoke, I will wear a cardigan or something and put it in a bag in the trunk when I am done. It does no good to cover the smell in your car if they can smell it all over you.... and Mr. Hefner didn’t wear a smoking jacket for nothing....."

I love the spray and trust me it works to get rid of any smell you can think of but it can ruin carpet, material, paint. It can also remove barcode off your drivers license lol, it did it to mine. Dawn dish detergent can get it out if clothes. That's why I bought cheap mats (not rubber too slippery) I spray on them. When I wash car I rinse mats out."
Drivers who smoke. What special things do you do to make sure you don't get dinged on your ratings?,Bigfrank,7370,7365,Well I have rubber mats so where do you suggest that I can spray it ?
Drivers who smoke. What special things do you do to make sure you don't get dinged on your ratings?,momof4,7372,7370,Good question. I spray into  my vents I just quickly wipe off excess but I don't spray them often at all. I'll have to think about this one lol. I always use mats but mine are carpet. I only paid 8.00 for 4 mats at Walmart depends on how bad you need to use the spray (I don't mean that in a sarcastic or mean way). I can tell you spray works get many compliments how good my car smells and no one ever smells cigarettes. The con to the spray is it's very greasy and can potentially stain. Maybe spray a wash cloth that you can conseal under driver and front passenger seat or go with cheap mats. If I come up with anything else I will share

Drivers who smoke. What special things do you do to make sure you don't get dinged on your ratings?,WendyC,7506,7365,Try Ozium. It’s not greesy at all and smells delightful! I too smoke in my car and have not jad any complaints since using it. You can get it at Walmart or local grocery store for about 2.49 a bottle
Drivers who smoke. What special things do you do to make sure you don't get dinged on your ratings?,momof4,7508,7506,I used that for awhile. It does work. Just found blunt Effects works somewhat better. As it also takes smell off my clothes as well. I don't spray on my clothes it just clings to you from spraying in car. Ozium isn't greasy either so in that respect it is better than blunt Effects. I don't think Ozium last as long. I like the many scents blunt Effects has. Definitely one or other are both great sprays and they do work.

hand:  if it's much brighter than mine, I sometimes tell them that who ever sits up front can't use their phone during the ride.  So far I've found solo pax more agreeable than accompanied pax.Meanwhile have you noticed that some of your most challenging rides occur when a couple declines to sit together in the back seat?  If so, do you have any tips for minimizing such challenges?Generally when a couple gets in my car, they both sit in the back seat.  Occasionally though, one member of what's evidently a couple sits up front.  Often it seems the couple has has some unresolved tensions that tend to surface even during a brief ride.I figure there isn't much a driver can do here.  I wish I could tell pax that if they're a couple, they must both sit in back, but A) it's not my business whether or not they're a couple; B) passengers like to choose their own seats; and C) I'd rather not choose where a pax sits without stating a reason I expect to make sense to them, and I'm not there yet.It's not so uncommon for pax to squabble with each other in my car, but I've noticed it almost never becomes a major challenge for me when they're both sitting in back.  Moreover when I do attempt to manage such challenges, I find way more success when both pax are sitting in back.My main tactic so far is that if couples are squabbling as I'm approaching the entrance to the highway, I ask them please for safety to cut out the drama while we are on the highway.Anyway I gather that a pax who sits beside the driver tends to feel they are more on the driver's side, and they expect me to reciprocate.  It's like maybe they feel we up front are the adults in the car.  But I intend to serve the one pax who booked the ride, no matter where they sit.  So I try to make that arrangement clear at the start of the ride, by identifying which pax booked the ride, and sometimes I tell their companions that they are guests of the pax who booked the ride.This arrangement though seems lost on some pax who seem to treat me like a taxi driver working for the whole party.  It also seems lost on some pax, who book rides for themselves and their companions, that if they'd prefer to minimize undue conversation, they might say so to me or try to restrain their companions from peppering me with questions, especially if they are sitting in back where I can't see their reactions to conversations.Meanwhile I've read posts by some drivers who say that sometimes we don't feel like having a passenger up front.  I guess I'm one!  Generally I like the company, but dislike when a pax sits up front and then stays on their phone the whole time.  Also if a pax's ride is less than ten minutes, I'd rather they sit in back.But of course they choose their seat before I know how long their ride is.  And though I don't hesitate to tell pax I'm not changing the music to suit them during a five-minute ride, I sure hesitate to ask a pax to sit in back simply because I'd rather keep them at arm's length for our brief ride.Further I gather that banishing a pax to the back would feel to them like a demotion.  I've never had a passenger move from the front to the back after getting into my car.So if I need certain pax not to sit up front, then I need either to work it out before they get into the car, or else accept that such ride might end early.  But it's pretty challenging to tackle before pax get into the car.Most pax are not so challenging, so I slide by, most of the time, without imposing any rules on them.  Whenever I state rules, including a ban on eating inside my car, most pax are very displeased, no matter how necessary the rule is or how politely I say it.I'm particularly interested in the driver who recently wrote in this forum that he ends the rides of any pax who touches him.  Getting touched actually is not an issue for me:  I like the rule though because I think it makes sense to most passengers.  The behaviors that concern me, I think would be less clear to many pax.I consider the space directly over my shoulder to be my personal space.  When a pax, riding shotgun, insistently takes this space to communicate (using their hands, phone, or voice) with other pax, I find it hard to accept.Moreover I haven't quite decided yet how to communicate my need here to pax effectively.  Indeed it probably makes sense not to try, because the few pax who've done this, out of my 1000 rides, seem quite unlikely to respond well to reason.While just a few passengers act too aggressively, they strongly tend to be accompanied pax who sit up front.I do have an inkling at the start that they are acting a bit aggressively.  So far I've been able, safely enough, to get through all but a couple of those tough rides.  But for safety moving forward I'm thinking I'd rather hash things out at the start--even at the risk of some undue conflict--than keep having a few pax invade my personal space insistently while I'm driving in traffic.I strongly prefer to give pax a warning before ending any ride.  What if I told some front-seat, accompanied pax that I don't tolerate invasions of my personal space, nor am I willing to argue at all about what's over the line?  In the space directly over my right shoulder, I need them not to raise their voice, gesture, or hold their phone at all.In sum, I need a pax riding shotgun not to use the space over my right shoulder as their space to face the back seat.  If they need to face pax in the back, then they need either to please sit in back with them or please find another driver.Does my need here fall into the realm of common sense?Anyway my best plan overall I think is to continue to handle these challenges as they arise, but I'm somewhat concerned because the one time I ended a ride early, the pax got belligerent and verbally abusive, even though I'd given them several warnings, it was multiple pax simultaneously making a huge racket with their phones and voices; and the ride was otherwise going well.  In this case, while driving I told one of the pax I needed her to turn off her phone's volume immediately.  She responded by shouting ""Why?  I pulled over, dropped them off, and did not respond to their verbal abuse.Similarly I might tell an invasive front-seat passenger I need them to keep out of the space over my shoulder, preferably by moving to the back seat.  After I've said so, if they persist, I might end their ride early and zip my lip.Read less..."
Who gets to ride shotgun?,BrianTheScrewDriver,17020,Whogetstorid,"This is hilarious. I especially like this one:Or how about this one:  your pax sits in back while their guest rides shotgun.  The guest bonds in conversation with you as the driver, but the pax who booked the ride gets so displeased about it, they rate you poorly?It's like a love triangle. I bet a pax like that is super insecure and always gets jealous of his/her friends.I wonder what part of calling an Uber he/she thinks creates a special relationship between him/her and the driver?

Who gets to ride shotgun?,dracomalfoy,5252,Whogetstorid,This is the longest post on seating etiquette I have ever read. I dislike when riders sit directly behind me as the only passenger. It freaks me out a little.I really don't care who sits up front and have never had an issue with a person who booked the ride getting mad at me for their friend sitting up front. I do prefer though that if there is space in the back that the passengers fill the back space first before sitting up front as I do use the front seat as a place for a few of my belongings.
Who gets to ride shotgun?,emerymahon,5280,Whogetstorid,"I think you are in the right here. I may not ask couples to specifically sit together, that seems weird but to have ""rules"" for the front seat such as no bright phone light, no talking over my shoulder or jesturing in my space, etc that all makes sense."
Who gets to ride shotgun?,brownbear,5255,Whogetstorid,When I take an uber somewhere I always sit in the back. If we have three people then I will usually just ask the driver if they mind if I sit in the front. Seems like basic etiquette to me but I guess not everyone shares that...

Rather than the flat $15?,EjiEzeEze,Retrievinglo,0,"I feel like this happens at least once a month.  A rider would leave something in the car, usually a phone or wallet, and when they contact you, they say:1) ""I can't live without my phone.  I need it tonight.""2) ""I am at locatio XYZ.  It's 20 miles away.""I appreciate Uber enforcing the $15 flat fee (since a few years ago), but I fell like that really doesn't cover the expense.  The time lost and the miles driven (considering gas) would put me in the negative territory.Why not make it simple?  The passenger needs to pay time and distance for me to get there?  Just like if I were to drive a person.  It seems fair to me."

You really think I went out LOOKING for a job that pays minimum wage to drive all night on the world’s lumpiest streets?’I wonder what he says to garbage truck workers who get in his way? Or panhandlers? “Got any spare change” could be a vocation, I suppose.Anyhow, all this has little or nothing to do with the main story. I’d ended going waaaay out into the sticks with a couple of rides with nice people and finally picked up a foursome of Hispanic kids who were headed down the 45 minute ride to stand in line at a club downtown. I gave out hand warmers  (we’re right between cool water and hot hands—it’s a seasonal thing) and gave them access to my Bluetooth. I’ve found that tuning them into the stereo is a lot easier than an aux cord once you figure out how to do it.So, we were heading downtown with all six speakers and two amplifiers pounding out…..well, someone very loud and fast. All I know was that it beat the 3 hours of “trap music” I’d enjoyed several weeks before. That almost had me cutting my head off with the power windows.About halfway to downtown, we got onto Interstate 270 which splits off from the Pennsylvania Turnpike at Somerset (the Land of A Thousand Motels) and splits north and south right before it ends at the Washington Beltway. Yes, it splits. Cars moving at a nice 75 mph come howling down to a very long split with signs everywhere and either head for the fleshpots of Virginia or the fleshpots of College Park. (I wouldn’t know a fleshpot if I tripped over it.)Yes, most of the cars are doing 75mph but I’m a conservative guy and locked it in on 60 with cruise control. The chatter was constant between the 4 kids and the rear speakers were shaking the whole car (I’m sneaky and move the fader to the rear when the customer has control).Then , this happened:Yes, some out-of-state moron had managed to ignore 3 MILES of signs and at least a half mile of solid dividing line and was stopped completely in the fast lane to Virginia. I had 1050p on the dash cam but I still couldn’t read his plate or he’d be getting a visit from the local constabulary. Of course on that road at night, rear lights with no brake lights or flashers is just the guy driving in front of you—he came up at me at, well 59 mph. Damn, that’s fast.The reaction was completely reflex. I think it came from my lower spine and my brain never got involved. I hit the brakes—which are ABS—and then, I came up off them so I could steer. Most people tend to forget that ABS brakes stop you in a straight line and a straight line is very seldom what you want in an accident situation. As soon as I bled off 20 mph or so, I swerved right and immediately back left to stay in the lane. I didn’t think there was someone right to my right side but I sure couldn’t look to see so I tried really hard to stay in the lane.Moron face finally realizes that he’s about to get dropkicked into the Montgomery Mall (about a half-mile ahead) and hit the gas and the brakes at the same time and moved into the median WHERE HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE FIRST PLACE.I will testify in court that the high-pitched scream was the young lady next to me. I wouldn’t scream that high—it would be lower and with real cuss words. The rest of the ride was calm—except I took three wrong turns to get them to their club and then pulled across the street and parked…to get the film out of the camera.Sure, get the film. That was it.Then, I found that I’d lost my wallet somewhere and spent two hours backtracking in a useless attempt to find it. I told my wife that Someone might be telling me that Uber was Over.Lessons:Never go for speed. Just mosey along.Never stop watching everywhere. Idiots are out there trying to kill you.Keep the brakes fixed. I never have a problem with tires since DC has eaten 12 in 2 years.Don’t stay on the brakes if you have a chance. Back off until you have some turning adhesion and get out of the way of anyone who’s behind you. Let him hit the moron while you are safely off to the side.Turn off as many automatic self-driving gizmos as you can. An automatic stopping computer would have been fighting me all the way.Finally, don’t assume that your riders don’t know what you’ve been doing to keep them safe. The kids gave me about $60 in a monster tip.Read less..."

Guessing Uber worried not enough drivers will be out for New Years Eve,momof4,11037,GuessingUber,Just got a notice for another promotion New Years Eve 10pm to 4am 12 rides $60.00. That's better:)
Guessing Uber worried not enough drivers will be out for New Years Eve,momof4,11035,GuessingUber,Usually have to do 40 trips in a week for $20.00. They took away all Promotion bonuses for Christmas week except for a few consecutive trip bonuses in Center City. This is for Philadelphia. If you do 12 trips do you get $40? Doubtful but just thought I would ask.  Any drivers from other cities get better Promotions for New Years Eve?
Guessing Uber worried not enough drivers will be out for New Years Eve,bob,11055,GuessingUber,Im a rider. What is a quest? Do you get quests a lot? Sounds like a game...

I have capability to drive Uber XL but I also drive Uber X ( not enough XL requests)which then makes me available for express pool and pool. The last 2 options are not worth it as my gas mileage is awful. New Years Eve Uber offered $20.00 for 6 rides and $60 for 12 rides between 10pm and 2am. I was lucky and made over 12 rides with only 1 pool ride. During the week Uber post 7 (I think) different quest/promotions ex. 30 rides 15.00, 40 rides 20.00. The money that is paid out is pd. by Uber not the rider. If driver is tired but only 2 rides left to hit bonus of course they will stay out to complete quest.

Yes, there are things that happen as your ready to walk out but have the decency to at least notify your driver. Most people dont even apologize. If you make driver wait you should definately be tipping that driver. This is one of the reasons your ratings fall. Making the driver wait. I am not necessarily directing the wait issue to you personally. Just hoping to educate riders if they are reading this.Last year had a rider puke in my car New Years Eve (no didnt report it) the husband cleaned the inside door which wasnt bad at all. Most of the mess was outside on door and quarter panel. He did hand me 20.00 to wash outside which is what I spent that day to wash it. It was enough of a mess to take me off the road because time would've ran out or my doors and locks would've froze.   I was 1 trip off of hitting my quest of 65.00.Read less..."

Guessing Uber worried not enough drivers will be out for New Years Eve,RedANT,11042,GuessingUber,"They're trying entice people to do shorties rather than the profitable long runs.  Regardless, when you have 90% of the active drivers in your city driving, hitting that 6 hr quest isn't going to be as easy as people imagine it will be."
Guessing Uber worried not enough drivers will be out for New Years Eve,momof4,11043,11042,"Of course. They never give you anything for nothing. There is always a catch. Usually to keep you the road longer accepting crappy rides. They probably have better Promotions for drivers that take all rides. I do not. So the big question to accept pool or not? Only if it's my last 2 rides to hit 12. Otherwise they can keep their money. Pool and express pool so not worth the aggravation unless there is a big surge attached or consecutive ride bonus. Last week caught both surge, consecutive ride bonus and 3 very nice people. One actually tipped a few bucks. Two were express and were actually out there waiting in right spot.

Guessing Uber worried not enough drivers will be out for New Years Eve,momof4,11076,11042,It was the 1st time someone puked. I only drove 4 days out of month.  The inside just looked wet on the door. Didnt even resemble puke. Although the outside was messy nothing a car wash couldn't fix. I really didnt think Uber would do much considering most of it went outside the car. I guess looking back I could've brought up that i lost bonus because of it.The 3 times anyone that has thrown up in my car it has been contained for the most part. Friends with those people help me clean up it took 10 min. They have been helpful and nice and will tip. I just dont have the heart to report it. Thats a lot of money to be taken out of their account.  If rider pukes and its all down my seats and in my carpet then I would report it.  All 3 incidents were easy clean up mostly on outside. Just dont feel right charging someon 200.00 for quick easy clean up.

Guessing Uber worried not enough drivers will be out for New Years Eve,RedANT,11050,11034,"They do quests for a reason...If they put out a 10 rides in 6 hrs quest and oversaturate the market with drivers, many/most will NOT finish it in time, so it costs them near nothing and  prevents surge.  In the end they have a lot more drivers driving at much lower rates, the passengers are happy and it was all subsidized by drivers who gave up their holiday to subsidize the profit margins of the rideshare companies.   From what I hear, many of the drivers who gave up their holiday didn't make much more than they do on any other night of the year.Sadly, few will learn from this experience, and Uber/Lyft will refine the process next year to further maximize their bottom line at the expese of drivers."

Uber to start paying drivers to switch to electric cars,drivenmad,Ubertostartp,0,Uber is testing out a new program where they will pay an extra $1 per trip completed to drivers who are driving electric or hybrid vehicles.https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/19/17480044/uber-electric-vehicle-ev-driver-cash-incentive
Uber to start paying drivers to switch to electric cars,lacy,4845,Ubertostartp,"This is a wonderful incentive, but honestly not enough to cause anyone to change their vehicle. Hybrid vehicles cost a great deal more and the quantity of fares for this to make economic sense is difficult to even imagine. Electric vehicles are even more pricey. They can go about 100 miles before they need to be charged, 30 minutes if you are lucky enough to find a lightning charging station but up to 12 hours otherwise. These stations are not close together and the odds of breaking down due to a lack of charge are pretty high in most areas.If they really want to encourage this they need to lobby for a better infrastructure because at the moment there is not nearly enough support for electric vehicles for them to be a viable option for rideshare."
Uber to start paying drivers to switch to electric cars,JWileySmith,4968,4845,"Are you a driver?  Feasibility aside, would this even make sense financially?  EV cars cost more money, albeit some good tax benefits.How many rides do you give in a day?  In a Year?  I am trying to do the math on how much that adds up to at $1.00~$1.25 a ride."
Uber to start paying drivers to switch to electric cars,lacy,4974,4968,"Yes, I am a driver. I give between 20 to 35 rides a week.

Even if you can find the fast chargers that is at least an hour while I am waiting to be able to make more money. I figure this because conservative estimates of the time you can drive it are about two to two and a half hours. This lessens with the use of accessories such as radio and air conditioning. I would be 1 star rated if I did not have the a/c running here because of the temperature year round.

I do live in Houston, so there is a lot of infrastructure in place for gas vehicles already and some for E-85 but almost none for electric. There are 18 charging stations in the greater Houston area, and 13 are clustered together in the midtown area. The city can easily take two hours to cross with regular traffic, so the odds of needing to charge at least once while out are very high.Some of these stations also belong to companies and are exclusively for their employees so the number is unreliable. So until there is a solid infrastructure where people can stop to charge their cars within at least every 50 miles in major metro areas this incentive is nothing but a feel-good measure that will affect no one that would not have already bought an electric car.Read less..."

Tipping Guide for Millennials. Unfortunately not one mention of Uber/Lyft.,momof4,10483,10470,"Lol. True but this article stated some services jobs should be tipped just not Uber/Lyft.   If millennials were writting them it would read ""never tip anyone ever again, so not necessary:) In their mind they feel no need to tip anyone for anything,  no need to work hard, dont know what a 40 hr work week is, have no work ethic, dont feel they should call out of work, they just don't show up & think thats ok, and lets not forget they feel its ok to be on their phone while at work when they feel like it as long as they feel like it. Heaven forbid you ask them to get off their phone & do some work. They look at you like ypu lost ypur mind."

Article on Drivers Wages. What are your thoughts?,momof4,9765,9759,"I notice a difference from last year.  When I started driving in July 2017 I drove 1 to 2 days per week. Usually Friday and Saturday. I had more trips, better trips, good surges, better tips, more tips, barely any pool, and very small amt of short trips. Since I started driving more hours starting in May 2018. It's been awful. Tips are lower ( maintained same rating as last year), maybe 1 surged ride per month (get slightly more with new surge), longer pick ups, many short rides, more pool, less money. I made more driving less days and less hours. It seems when you are a new driver working a couple days,  less than 20 hrs. you get good trips once you are with Uber more than 12mths things decline. Trips have longer pick ups, more pool, less trips, etc... Uber does not want good, reliable, high rated drivers. As you become more experienced, understand things more, see whats going on, Uber doesnt want you anymore. Just my opinion and my experience."

Article on Drivers Wages. What are your thoughts?,momof4,9723,9722,In my opinion not here in Philadelphia. Too much wear and tear on car. Uber pool and pool express dont pay enough. Not many tips. Part time maybe to make few dollars  but definately not full time. Riders ratings getting lower and lower afraid to pick up so you decline. Not as many rides too many drivers. Tuesday and Wednesday very slow. A lot of short trips. I am only doing it for the flexibility right now but really considering something else.Cant stay on top of my bills. I did better making 10.00 per hr 40 hrs a week than I do with uber. This is just my opinion.

How are Uber passengers and Lyft passengers different?,EjiEzeEze,4095,HowareUberpa,"LYFT PASSENGERS TIP MORE .  BY FAR.Most likely due to the history where Lyft has long time offered tipping in their app and Uber only recently, it's more built into the culture of Lyft passengers.   80% of the time, I get tips from passengers, and they are 10~15%.With Uber?  It's more like 40~50% tipping and they tip like 2~5 bucks, regardless of the trip."
How are Uber passengers and Lyft passengers different?,bBerman81,4096,4095,It's possibly because Lyft passengers are often more experienced with rideshares and they know they are supposed to tip.  They are usually who tried Uber first and moved over to Lyft.  So they are more accustomed to it.Uber passengers can be ignorant anyone who doesn't even think about tipping. and many can be one-time users.

I’m using the phone as a phone for one thing but mainly I just don’t think about it.Two weeks ago, I actually got involved in someone’s troubles.I was waiting for three partiers to show up in one of the classier club zones about 2am and slowly realized that the shape in the gutter around the corner was a woman. She kept flailing her arms and managed to keep her coat and purse on her but she could not get up. I was fairly sure that she’d lead with her face on the way down so I called 911. My riders arrived and I asked if they would wait a minute until someone came to care for this woman. They agreed quickly—nice guys.Then a passing pedestrian helped the woman stand up and, damn, if she didn’t go staggering off down the street, across at the light, and into a hard-to-see boardwalk under a construction zone. I knew there was no way the police would see her. I’d followed along so I asked my riders if they minded me dealing with this. I still hadn’t started the ride and, as we all know, Uber Waiting Time is a joke.I got out and trotted across the street on my aching knees. Inside the construction boardwalk, she’d gone down again and this time, definitely smacked her face right into the concrete jersey barrier that was the base of the outside wall.The conversation was friendly, if strange.“Ma’am? Are you OK?”“I need to get the 92. That will take me home.”“The what?”“The 92 bus. It should be coming.”“Ma’am, you aren’t going to catch a bus. You’ve got marks and bruises all over your face.”“I’ve got to catch the 92.”“Well, you’re not. Are you sick?”“(In a harsh whisper) Drunk. Just Drunk”“Well, you still aren’t going anywhere.”I folded up her coat, put it under her head, thinking of all those Good Samaritans who get blamed when they move the body. She seemed fine.”Someone will be here soon.”A police car and a bicycle cop showed up I’d suggested an ambulance but they were probably busy with club shootings. (Remember, club shootings are only dangerous if you’re in that sort of club.)I said I was an Uber driver and had riders to take care of. One of the police asked for my name and phone so I gave him my Book Author Card. He looked mildly surprised at the four published books—none about drunks or Uber drivers. My riders were completely cool and even gave me some props for doing the right thing. We drove off and I never heard about it again.Yes, I HAD FORGOTTEN THE DAMN CAMERA.Another chance for media glory gone to hell. I guess I’ll never have the interior frost that had the cameraman in Medium Cool film the family in the car wreck and then leave to get the film to the station instead of helping the injured.

The comment I got from one was that delivering food means you need to get it there hot, which means you are driving too fast to be safe.So my question is, how many of you are driving for Uber Eats without insurance, and what will you do if you were to get in an accident?  I'll point out that the insurance companies are now onto ride sharing and food delivery realities and ask some hard questions. Plus they have access through a warrant to the app data.This year, at renewal, there were a lot more questions from my insurance companies regarding whether I drove for ride share or food delivery. I'm pretty sure that is the insurance companies setting themselves up to be able to deny coverage.Your thoughts?"

"Uber Eats, etc. and Insurance",breakingbread,7527,"UberEats,etc","I never realized this, I don't drive for Uber Eats though, just uberx. I don't understand why they would not cover food delivery drivers. ""driving faster"" is a BS answer. Maybe because you have to illegally park or park in dangerous situations sometimes to drop the food off? What about dominoes pizza delvierers? Are they insured through dominoes?"
Uber drivers. Have you noticed strange tip amounts?,momof4,Uberdrivers.,0,"In past 3 weeks I have been getting weird tip amounts (14.37, 12.23, 9.08, 11.78, and 10.33) I thought maybe the rider was just trying to even out the amount ex. Trip 10. 07 tip 4.93 =15.00, thought maybe they were using tip calculator. None of my logic worked out. I also have been getting tips (7) 3 to 11 days after the trip (although I know a rider can tip at later date) but seeing it more than usual. Just curious if anyone else out there is experiencing this also? Would appreciate the feedback."
Uber drivers. Have you noticed strange tip amounts?,Wes,8631,Uberdrivers.,"One of the tipping options is a percentage of the total fare.  I discovered that when I used Uber for personal transportation during a recent trip.  So they can use preset and amounts, or they can tip a percentage, which is how you end up with the unusual amounts.Yes, if the passenger doesn't tip immediately, there can be a delay of several days - that's out of our and Uber's control as we can't force them to tip immediately.It always bothers me when a tip shows up days later as we have no way of knowing which trip it was etc...  not that it really matters, but I wish they would at least refer to the trip so we can link it together."
Uber drivers. Have you noticed strange tip amounts?,momof4,8633,8631,"Thank you for your answer. When my tips show up days later I am able to click on transactions, tip, trip details and it shows me date, pick up location, and trip details. I havent checked since the new driver app came out but I could see it on old app. Yes, it is nice to see who tipped."
Uber drivers. Have you noticed strange tip amounts?,LG-PA,8643,Uberdrivers.,"HiYes I am starting to notice it more too now where $5.00-$10.00 in tips carry over from previous week, actually just noticed it on Lyft too, would be nice to see what trip(s) it was from ;)"
Uber drivers. Have you noticed strange tip amounts?,RedANT,8644,Uberdrivers.,The best are the ones that tip 10% of a minimum fare.  10% of $2.62 = 26 cent tip

Uber drivers. Have you noticed strange tip amounts?,scantilysam,8672,Uberdrivers.,"Yes, I have been seeing more tips later on than usual as well. I just noticed it the other night. Maybe Uber is sending a little tip reminder a few days later? Nah, they would never do that... IDK."
