Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,Applejack,34455,34454,Duh!
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,RodMoe,34456,1182,So would love another set or 15x8 in black for my wet race tires but it is low on my to do list atm.. GLWS Chalon...
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,PCA-1,35187,1182,Pricing is up!
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,BlackBird,35191,1182,"Someday, I'll snag a set of 15x8s. Also have to find a good tire to fit on those. Either too narrow, or straight up DOT stamped R-comps. :/ Nice pricing."
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,kamakazee,35220,1182,"Chalon, you're killing me! That High Power Silver set in 18X8 is so tempting... Do you have any pics of Fiestas with that color wheel?"
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,PCA-1,35221,35220,Not that I am aware of. Let me see what I can come up with.
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,PCA-1,35223,35220,"HPS is hard for me to replicate as my skills suck. That being said, the 1st pic is most realistic in color, but is of a 15"" wheel. The second pic is of an 18"" wheel so you can get a feel for the 18"" spoke length.Note, I do not have any more 18x8/4x108 on the way."

Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,kamakazee,35402,1182,"Awesome, thanks for doing that Chalon! Now I have something to ponder over..."
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,felopr,35404,1182,i wonder how the PB FiST would look with the gold rims...
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,PCA-1,35408,35402,And the price just went down too....
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,PCA-1,35409,35404,"The wheels came out a little fuzzy, but you get the idea."
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,felopr,35486,35409,that doesnt look bad at all imo
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,Slowclimb,35620,1182,Blue and gold...classic...loved it on the STI and think it still looks great 10 years later on the Fist...hoping my black and white combination looks as good.
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,PCA-1,36339,1182,Sets are selling!
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,Izzy,36366,1182,Wish the bronze were available in 16x8 or at least 16x7.5. Want to run a 225 tire.
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,Slowclimb,36367,1182,You can order any size you want.
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,Izzy,36370,1182,Oh...thought it was only the advertised sizes at the beginning of the thread...PCA-1 can I get a quote for a 16x8 flush offset. Torn between bronze and gold so let me know if color would change pricing...Thx.
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,Slowclimb,36391,1182,"those are the wheels he has in stock...the nice thing about PCA is that you can order specific size, offset, and color...takes some time to get the wheels, but worth it considering how limited the choices are for the fiesta bolt pattern."
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,Izzy,36406,1182,Negative...PCA confirmed...TD does not make a 16X8...gotta' keep looking.
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,Slowclimb,36408,1182,Bummer... These cars seem tough to find decent wheels for... Wish they used a 4x100 or some other common pattern
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,Izzy,36410,1182,"I'm going to give it till' the OEM tires need replacing. If by then, aftermarket has not embraced our 4x108 I'm performing a 4x100 conversion. This is getting ridiculous."

Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,BlueTurbo,37054,1182,"New to wheel buying, can somebody point me to or explain what I need to consider when buying wheels for the summer. I would like to go wider for more grip but not sure if it is possible....Any pros out there that can give some advice?"
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,Mister_Mino,37066,37054,"We are eventually going to drag you out to an autocross and to stay in stock class you can't go any wider. 17x7 or 16x7 and no more than a 41.xx (just say 42) ET backspacing. I'm sure you can fit an 8"" wide wheel but we can't fit much more than a 225 in most tires so I say why go wider? Just my $0.02"
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,PCA-1,37190,1182,Sets are selling!!! Final day of the sale!!!
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,FORZDA 2,37197,1182,"Yep, got my 15x8s in Anthracite. The look great, but are pretty heavy at 15.5 lbs. However, they are considerably lighter than the OEM wheels and 0.5lbs lighter than the 17x7 OZ Ultraleggera(16lbs) I run with summer rubber. Note that 949 Racing 6UL wheels in 15x8 weigh only 11.5lbs, but only come in 4x100 PCD.I have the 4x100 conversion hardware, but I'm not going to switch over unless it I find that it is really imperative for winning autocross events.Info:The 17x7 OZ wheels (including TPMS sensors) with Dunlop Direzza 215/40x17 mounted weighs 36.5lbsThe 15x8 TDM wheels (no TPMS sensors) with BFG G-Force R1 205/50x15 mounted weighs 33.5lbs"
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,PCA-1,37201,1182,"The 15x8 Pro Race 1.2 wheels are not heavy wheels, nor are they ultra lightweight wheels. The 6UL is (now) a flow formed wheel (the latest version), which should be lighter, and not have failures like previous versions. Waiting to see how the new version holds up. I am a bit reserved with the new flow formed/cast wheel combinations."
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,FORZDA 2,37210,37201,"Yep, the TDMs are excellent (strong) wheels and I plan to run them in autocross competition. I wasn't deriding them at all, but I haven't seen any detailed comparison discussion of their specs other than PSD and offsets. I also have a set of the first gen 6ULs on my supercharged Miata with no problems either."
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,PCA-1,37211,37210,"Understood. I feel the necessity to address weight as people can get the wrong impression.The Pro Race 1's had a spotty record years ago too at one point, and like your 1st gen 6UL's, some of those are still in use as well.A supercharged Miata sounds like a blast!"
Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,Slowclimb,37228,37197,Switching to a 4X100 is going to bump you from HS into a class that no matter how light your wheel is you are very unlikely to win.

Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,PCA-1,39422,39412,"Competition rally wheels are typically 15"". That being said, street wise, a multispoke white wheel will certainly give off the rally feel/look."

Update:Team Dynamics Wheels for your Fiesta ST!,FORZDA 2,40294,1182,"Yeah, I'm already headed to CSP/STX so I'm staying with the 4x108 15x8 TDM wheels for now and may go with some 9s later. I've sold off some toys (the '03 SC Miata and '07 MazdaSpeed6 are gone) and will play harder with the FiST over the next few years.

ST Suspension Rebate *Expired*,PCA-1,21397,1216,Rebate period has ended.
ST Suspension Rebate *Expired*,Golfguy11800,25952,1216,"Getting ""low"" won't be a priority for me, rather I want to make sure these coils can endure heavy track work. Will these coilovers be able to withstand a beating on the track? I want to make sure they were designed for speed and driveability and not just for ""stance.""-Chad"
ST Suspension Rebate *Expired*,Cesso,25956,1216,"Considering that this is KW's budget brand and these coilovers are actually identical to the KW-V1 except for they use lower grade metals and don't come with the lifetime warranty, I'd say these are probably the best budget coilovers you can get. For me though suspension is somewhat of an all or nothing thing, and I'd rather wait for real KW-V3's before putting coils on my car."
