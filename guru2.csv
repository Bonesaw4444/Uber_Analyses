Should Uber drivers have to get physicals?,MikeMill,ShouldUberdr,0,"How come no one ever talks about the physical side of Uber drivers. Everyone focuses on the background checks but shouldn't drivers have to be cleared from any pre-existing conditions that would make them dangerous drivers?? All taxi, public transportation drivers have to pass physicals and I think Uber drivers should too."
Should Uber drivers have to get physicals?,Bigfrank,20126,ShouldUberdr,"I can tell you what 30 plus years of driving gave me starting from the bottom : foot pain, vericose , leg cramps , hemmoroids, back pain, enlarged prostrate , digestive issues, acid reflux, finger and wrist pain neck pain and headaches ."
Should Uber drivers have to get physicals?,MikeMill,20130,20126,"Oof, that sucks! I hadn't thought about the opposite side of driver health like this either - the effects it has on the drivers. And of course it's not like Uber offers health insurance..."
Should Uber drivers have to get physicals?,RedANT,20125,ShouldUberdr,"There are a lot of dangerous rideshare drivers, but most are dangerous due to their driving habits and (in)experience, and not based on a physical disability. ¬†What situations have you seen that indicate that physical conditions are a problem?"
Should Uber drivers have to get physicals?,MikeMill,20129,20125,"I guess I haven't seen anything first hand, but this thought just struck me the other day. You could have a driver whose eyesight is poor or is at high risk for a stroke or heart attack while driving. I just find it interesting that there is no physical to become a rideshare driver."
Should Uber drivers have to get physicals?,RedANT,20131,20129,"Most Americans are ""at risk"" of heart attack or stroke, and having an arbitrary A1C requirement for consideration as a rideshare would unnecessarily destroy the pool of available drivers. You also (potentially) run into medical privacy issues, as well as violations of the ADA if disabled drivers are unreasonably excluded from employment.My late husband, an absolutely ripped retired US Marine, died from a heart attack while working out. Sometimes bad things happen to physically fit people too. ¬† As a disabled driver who has driven hundreds of thousands of miles over the years, (with only one speeding ticket ~40 years ago) I'm as safe a driver as you can find, but because of a irrelevant disability, I'd probably be kicked to the curb. ¬†I just don't see the merit of ""screening"" for problems where none really exist."

"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",StuffinMuffin,Themoreyouus,0,"I figured this would be the case.¬† With the introduction of upfront pricing, Uber can charge customers anything they want.¬† They will ask for any amount riders are willing to pay.¬† I have heard cases where during the hours when the business users are out, the overall fare goes up.¬† Trips to and from airports? You guessed it.¬† It'll go up because people are willing to pay.All the cheap Uber fares that we have gotten accustomed to are about to go out the window.¬† Regulators and law makers who shoved the taxis out.¬† Are you happy now?¬† What about those Uber fans who said, ""Uber is better and cheaper.¬† Screw the taxis.¬† Stronger survives.""¬† So irresponsible.¬† Here's the proof:""Uber appears to have the opposite of a rewards program. That is, it appears the more you use Uber as a passenger, the more they‚Äôre going to charge you per mile. Weknow Uber said they were going to experimenton charging different customers different rate, based on a variety of unpublished factors. My current belief is the more you use the service in a way that suggests you can afford more, the more they will charge you.""https://therideshareguy.com/uber-is-ripping-off-frequent-riders-and-heres-how-to-avoid-it/"
"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",LavishHaze,20047,Themoreyouus,Uber is such a shitty company. I‚Äôve spent more on Uber than than my actual travel. One time it was around the time 5pm and normally my fare is aboit $50 and suddenly it jumped to $170. That‚Äôs a huge jump then I waited 5-10 minutes then it went to $80 and then back at $50. What kind of bullshit is that? That is more than double my original fair? ¬†That‚Äôs 350% more. Wtf! There excuse of more in demand is such bullshit because if I wait 5 min the price changes. It‚Äôs just to see if people are willing to pay high in panic of pretending as if the customer won‚Äôt get a Uber in time. It‚Äôs no different than online shopping and then say ‚Äú12 people have this in their cart‚Äù or ‚Äúthis item is about to sell out‚Äù wait the 5-10 minutes and you‚Äôll see how the price goes down. Uber knows what they‚Äôre doing.

"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets. (Upfront Pricing)",scotchyscotchyscotch,3186,3139,This is an age-old tactic. Predatory pricing.

"The more you use Uber, the more expensive it gets.

Their goal (that everyone knew) has always been to grab the monopoly.Not to mention the economics of taxis have never been a highly profitable business. Uber disrupted an industry that was already established, with drivers and dispatchers. It was alreday working with very low margin. ¬†They removed it, and replaced it. It was basically just a deregulation.The problem is they added more bureaucracy to this where the company takes a huge cut (over 28%) of every ride even though they claimed to have created efficiency.

Since Uber won't give you details of trip; but, does assign you as closest to the call, Uber should then compensate you for going to where ever they are sending you. Whether the victim of a cancellation after driving 20 minutes to the pickup point, or the pickup is a two miles to the store ride. So the compensation should be two part. Drivers original location to pickup point and then pickup point to destination. If the driver reaches the pickup point, they are guaranteed compensation for that leg, no matter the outcome of the ride. Whether Uber wants to eat that addition to the drivers income or pass it on to the consumer, is up to them.If Uber assigns a ride that makes someone drive twenty minnutes to complete the task on Uber's behalf, then it is only right that they cover that cost of getting there.I think Uber should reduce it's take from the drivers money to a strict 15% of gross revenue and look for alternative revenue streams to make up the difference. For example the Unlimited 25% Club. Pay an annual membership of $49.99 and get a flat 25% off all your Uber rides. Use as many times as you like during the membership period.

Thus the company sets the rate of the ""gate"" fee the drivers pay to take out a car and in exchange they are only responsible for paying for gas while they use the car.No one gets rich in the taxi business, least of all any drivers, even those who own medallions which allow them to rent their car to another driver and for them to drive without paying the full ""gate"", the price to take out a car. Those drivers still pay a modest fee to the company for the use of the company color scheme painted on the car as well as access to the dispatcher.An Uber driver, by comparison is responsible for all costs and pays Uber a commission for access to the ""dispatch"" system, which is fully automated by computer and accessed only through a smart phone.If I had absolute power I would merge all the taxi companies into Uber, deal with the city authorities in a non adversarial manner and provide a service that was superior to the original taxi cab services and paid the drivers better than the current Uber model does.However, in order to do that, they would have to create a better incentive for drivers to stay out all night long, perhaps by accepting a much lower commission from drivers between the hours of 3AM and 6AM in order to keep cars on the road.The prices as they are today should probably rise by 50%-75% in order to be fair to the drivers as well as all the investors waiting to recoup the money they gave Uber to start up.Read less..."

"If you were the new CEO of Uber, with absolute power, what would be the first thing you'd change?",Bigfrank,4318,Ifyouwerethe,I would drop the star system and replace with acceptable and unacceptable. Then I will add a 15 % surcharge that goes directly to the driver which would be technically a tip . If a passenger rated said driver a unacceptable rating then they may explain why and then redeem their 15% bit also having the driver respond to the rating.The rates should in line with local yellow cab companies in which people can make their own choices on the type of car they perfer .

Also depends on UberX or UberBlack.The average passenger ratings are different from city to city.¬† With that said, most drivers feel the average passenger rating is about 4.6.¬†Perhaps we will venture a guess with this scale:Around 4.70~4.90 is good.Between 4.50~4.60 is¬†acceptableBelow 4.50 requires some caution.We have heard from drivers that they do not pick up passengers below 4.80 when it's busy or at airports where, once you are at the top of the queue, a request is guranteed. Furthermore, there seems to be a wide consensus among drivers that they won't pick up anyone below 4.50.For drivers, they average 4.7~4.80, and if they are 4.60 or below, they are in risk of being deactivated.¬† You rarely see above 4.90, unless you are in smaller cities.Any comments from the drivers?(UPDATE 2018/10/15: Adjusted the scale slightly and inserted a blurb on what ratings drivers would consider declining the requests.)ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Oct 15, 2018"

It's really scary to think that it would take just a few drivers who dinged me for something I was not aware of, or even in control of to make this means of even living out here inaccessible to me.I had a 4.98 for a long time, but it recently went down to 4.74 for some reason I am entirely clueless on. I have broken none of these suggestions and only ever had to cancel a ride once. But tonight my roommate was canceled on three times when I ordered a ride for him, and I'm now concerned that this will become even more of a thing because my rating is now below a 4.8.If drivers start a trend of canceling on us when we need them to be able to get to places, I may very well be forced to switch to Lyft, which is much harsher on my meager budget. The rides can sometimes get up to fifty dollars for a twenty-minute trip, stranding me somewhere for hours because I can't afford to pay that much. That's two weeks of groceries.Read less..."

I can only speak for myself and what I do. I do not rate a rider under 5 stars unless they did something really really annoying, rude, totally disrespectful. I have over 1825 rides. I can count on 1 hand how many riders I rated 2 to 4 stars. Trust me there should've been about 35 more added to that number. My issue is if I rated rider 3 stars I have to give reason why. ¬†Lets say they made me wait 8 min didnt apologize, left trash all over the car, was rude & disrespectful. I tell that to Uber I now have to worry that rider retaliates and rates me 1 star. If a rider takes 1 Uber per mth & their rating goes down a week after their ride with me they know who did it. Riders have 2/3 weeks to rate we have 5 secs. Lets say I drop you off and driver all ready accepted another ride in last 3 min of your ride. You arrive at destination driver swipes end trip & wants to move on but the rating pops up & we cant get go any further in the app until we rate. If they ard busy and trying to rush maybe they accidentally hit 1 stat or 3 stars instead of 5. Uber WILL NOT change a rating no matter what you tell them for driver or rider. Maybe driver hates rating system so he just clicks whatever to get passed that screen. Not saying its fair but maybe these are reasons. Lyft gives driver 24 hrs to rate rider. Uber gives 5 secs. ¬†Rider gets 2/3 weeks on Uber and not sure on Lyft but its at least 24hrs.Here is another senario. I am not being sarcastic or rude but here is a possibility your rating is not 5 stars. You state "" I am tired, work hard, long hrs, you TRY to be FRIENDLY companion if I MUST"". ¬†""Really would like to rest, catch up on work, but long ago I ¬†REALIZED they WONT let me I listen and reply in as FRIENDLY WAY AS I CAN"". ¬† I get it yes sometimes its nice to have a conversation with your rider but you worked your long day you are tired you may want peace and quiet. Totally understandable. I cant agree more after you worked all day who wants to hear other peoples problems. I totally agree i would do the same be nice, listen, agree (no driver should be sharing their problems, difficulties, or issues with you, they should keep conversation light, upbeat, and positive). Common sense to most but not all. I capitalized negatives to point out that you MAY enter car with a negative vibe because it seems you get those drivers that unload their problems on you. Its just going to be one of those rides you dread. You are kind enough to listen, show compassion, and try to be friendly. But in reality you want peace and quiet and to be left alone. ¬†That is your right and no one should tell you your rude. It could be possible tbat a few drivers are picking up that you are just going along & being nice because you have to. ¬†Even though you think & feel you are handling these types of drivers wonderfully they may see through it. They also may feel it is fake and your just being condescending. When in fact you feel you are being nice, polite, and friendly. Again not saying you are fake, not saying you should have to change or talk to driver the whole ride. If I have a bad rider and immediately pick another rider up I may smile, i may talk, i may say all the right things but there are times i can feel some awkwardness, negativity in the car becausd of previous rider. Once I realize this I have to let go of the negativity and the anger from previous rider or this will continue after each and every rider. Some people are more sensitive than others and can feel negative energy, vibes, presence, auora whatever you want to call it. Agsin not trying to be rude.Try this next time. Get in the car smile, say good morning, how are you. Driver says my back is killing me, Uber dont listen to its dtivers, my husband is ¬†lazy blah blah blah. Respond with sorry i hope things get better for you I had a rough day also i had to bring my work home with ¬†me so if you will excuse me I have emails i have to answer, vm to listen to, texts to get out or I may just nod off for an hour. At end of ride simply say thank you for giving me quiet time I accomplished a lot or the nap really helped. That should shut that type of driver down and now you can do whatever and not have deal with that type of driver shut it down from beginning. If uncomfortable text driver "" good morning i have a ton of work to catch up on or need a nap i would appreciate the quiet ¬†time. These 2 things can prevent you from having to fake wanting to talk or listen to their problems ¬†sorry couldnt think of another way to phrase it:) ¬†See if it helps it cant hurt. Headphones are great. Get in and say i had a rough day going to stick headphones on and take a nsp or relax. Driver knows you are occupied and comfortable they can concentrate on the roadI think their should be icons you can click ahead of time if you want ex. Open for conversation ¬† ¬†dont want to talk ¬† please have air on ¬† give choices of music so driver if they want can put what you like on. Good luck.Read less..."

Drivers are independent contractors, think of us like plumbers. If ¬†I fixed your faucet one time and you were rude, next time you called me I would not service you (despite your offer to pay me).Drivers are not signing up to drive to drive rude passengers either, but often we are indeed doing just that.

What's a typical passenger rating for Uber? Is 4.50 good?,momof4,8722,5844,Did you call or text the driver when you couldnt get out of the building? Did you tip the driver for making them wait. That 5 min could've cost that driver another ride that paid well or maybe a ride that wouldve tipped. A text or phone call to the driver when you will be late is common courtesy. Did you offer the driver a few dollars for him to drop gloves off? Again you are causing driver to lose time. Time is money to drivers.

However ;those cab drivers are unfriendly with their passenger , busy and making a space always who are not talkative with there passenger as long they are looking for a quite and relaxation service like that and also they don't have any friendly greeting their riders like us as an Uber's partners.However;If those arrogant riders ignoring us as a friendly drivers like to have a quite ride with your phone texting ,talking and chatting with people with you keeping the uber driver ignored by treating us as a server or slave its will be better for them to take a public transport up such as a taxi cab , shuttle , bus or luminous which is fair enough if they don't show us any friendly treatment with a respect as a human being.

The late night trip was a 40min cross London trip, we were tired so we weren't loud and we didn't have food with us (pick up was a gay bar, so that may be a factor). Being from the UK and especially not being from London, I tend not to tip, although it seems I really should be, even though it's not in our culture per se, I've worked in the service industry, we don't expect tips here, they are just a bonus if you do.

So after 15 of min of no further response after she drove off (had already waited 10 min before she arrived and pulled her ""you're not my fare act) I finally cancelled. I think she pretended I wasn't her fare as she had a very small car and I would have had to put a couple things on her back seat, and in fact she didn't make her claim til I started asking if that was ok.Stupid thing is... the next words out of my mouth would have been ""and I have a towel to put under them to make sure your seat doesn't get dirty"" (not that my bags are dirty, but just in case). And, that's also why I tip well- or at least I thought 45-50% cash tip (with a $5 min) was at least decent, esp considering otherwise I am a model passenger - as I know it takes an extra few minutes to put my stuff in the car and time = $.So wtf am I doing wrong, or could the low rating be just from that one driver? I did report what she did to Uber as that was a lot of bullshit - if she didn't want to drive me she should have cancelled herself, or at least messaged me and pretended she couldn't get to me or some lie that at least would have prevented me from standing there for another 15 min after a 15 hour work day.Btw, I also always give drivers a 5.0 rating, except that one chick. And as I live in a big tourist town and often get off work around 2am, the low rating does hurt me, as there are always a ton of drunk people requesting rides at that hour so I'm sure drivers think the rating means I must be one of them.... when in reality I am anything but!

How do I report bad drivers? (Uber and Lyft drivers that is),momof4,16724,16712,When you are getting ready to exit the car the driver should be clicking end trip and then the app notifies you. I can hear the notification my riders phones when I end the trip. Once you pull.up to destination why dont you just ask driver to end the trip before you exit the car? If that makes you uncomfortable as soon as you exit the car if trip is still running message Uber immediately. They are tracking your phone they will see you are at your destination while on the app. Take a selfie if you have to standing at your destination. What city are you in? Sounds like you have a lot of dishonest drivers there. I mentioned drivers have nothing to do with your credit card because initial post made it sound as if you were saying drivers were charging your card or they had your card. If this is an ongoing issue as you said best advice is what I mentioned above. Ask driver to end trip before you get out. Hope that fixes your issue. Best if luck:)

All the things that will be in the window are all ready right in front of rider in their app. This opens up more people to make false accusations. If you are a pedestrian thst witnesses an Uber driver doing something wrong take down their license plate and send message to Uber they can find who the driver is by the license plate. Why should a driver put personal info like their name for all to see?¬† Again if they do anything wrong their is the license plate and if its of criminal nature call police with their license plate.

In most states, your friend's name only has to be listed on the vehicle's insurance policy. In some states, especially where the insurance follows the driver (rather than car), Uber seems to require your friend's name to be listed on the registration as well.On a side note: this¬†is a growing problem for the rideshare industry, where Uber drivers either let other people drive to take maximum advantage of the car OR they sign up under one vehicle and drive someone else's cars, etc. a rental.ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Aug 15, 2021"

Period.Say racist or bigoted things while thinking I‚Äôll agree with you because you‚Äôre rating me.If your destination is too far/not possible (across the bay bridge from SF to East Bay at 7 a.m.).#5 is no hard feelings and I feel bad, but it turns my entire shift into taking you to the East Bay for about $20. The big problem comes on the return trip. After I drop you off, I have to wait in line for 2 hours without earning anything (even with Fastrak). I lose A TON of money and my landlord doesn‚Äôt accept kindness as a form of rent payment.If you do #1 ‚Äì #4 than you can go play in traffic while blindfolded for all I care.Read less..."

I had a 4.52 the other night I posted in comments below that I shouldnt of accepted. Lyft is useless everyone is 4.9 or 5 stars. On the few occassions I see a 4.8 I dont accept. Thats a low rating on Lyft. lolI just want to add when you pull up make sure your doors are locked. Ask who they are and who their driver is. It gives you 10/15 secs to check out their demeanor, attitude, & possibly how intoxicated they are. I sometimes say ""sorry didnt realize doors were locked"" if they seem annoyed (diesn't happen often). If I am not sure but suspect an issue I will talk to them and fiddle around with my phone (another 10/15 secs) blaming the app before I start trip.

If we cancel we get $3.75 on Uber and $5 on Lyft, and they are also then blocked from rating us.Guess which option I pick?I'll take the cancel fee for $200 Alex and answer ""what does a driver do with jerks"", and I'll send a note to support to block them from my account (and after a few of these ntoes from drivers, those passengers lose their account access and are bared from taking any rides).You Are Not Entitled to a RideNo one is entitled to get a ride.Using rideshare is a privilege, not a right.If you treat your driver poorly, you deserve to be dropped off at the nearest safe location.This is NOT a taxi cabThis is NOT a car for hire.This is NOT a limo for entitled millennialsThis is my private, personal vehicle, and you are a guest in it.

After seeing her rating I am sure she pulls this all the time. Her destination was NY 40.90 are added to the fare for tolls and a 20.00 surcharge for driver if they are not a NY driver. A NY trip usually runs a rider over 100.00 on a 45/60 min ride.Second thought was she could tell Uber I picked up wrong rider, I got lost, i was intoxicated or any other BS she could come up with along with a 1 star so she could get her $ back. My ratings could take the hit but what about a false report that could get me deactivated? My motherly side and conscience won. I took her and hoped for the best. However I needed to try and say or do something to ensure she wouldn't try to send a false report to Uber.My Turn to BS My RiderMe - Since there are so many issues with drivers assaulting riders & doing bad things Uber will contact me after I drop you off. ¬†They will ask why I dropped you off so far from your destination. I'll explain what happened but I'll tell them you made a mistake. I wont tell them you purposely put in wrong address because you didnt have enough $ in your account to pay for an Uber. That you offered me cash for the rest of the ride. You would get deactivated. ¬†Then I lied even more. Uber could report you to your bank for Knowingly ordering a service & not having the funds in there (it's like writing a bad check). Figured at her age she wouldnt know much about checks. I can back all that up with the video and audio I have from my dashcam. I'll just edit the beginning part out so they dont know what you really did. Good thing our whole conversation and interaction is on my dashcam so I can just upload it to Uber if needed.Rider - Thank you so much I really appreciate it.Who knows maybe she didnt believe my BS. I just wanted her to know that if she tried I had everything recorded. I did nothing wrong this was all on her and I had proof. Although Uber dont always care. Yes I did take a big chance but again I just couldnt leave her on the side of the road. It was a situation that never happened to me. If this were to happen again I would probably find a spot to let her out safely. ¬†I did get my full fare for the miles, time, correct Bridge toll, NJ TP toll, and the additional $20 surcharge because I am a PA driver(out of state), cant pick up in NY, & tolls we occur on way back. That time of morning I take the no toll way back as there is no traffic & puts me back in the area where its busy, where I want to be accepting more long trips. ¬†So 27 months haven't thrown anyone out.

"Can I ask my Uber driver to NOT record me with his webcam? If I do not want to be recorded, shouldn't I be able to request that?",shipbuilderpilot,18070,17794,Very good post. I've been driving for Uber about a week pulled up to a bar had a woman get in who was not my pickup. My rider was waiting for me to get this person out of car. Video and audio saved me as I just called the police to have her removed she claimed all kinds of crap police reviewed video sent me on my way while she was arrested for public intoxication. I will never agree to turn off my camera or audio this is a perfect example of why we need one in the first place.
"Can I ask my Uber driver to NOT record me with his webcam? If I do not want to be recorded, shouldn't I be able to request that?",daisygirl,16344,CanIaskmyUbe,Since it is the drivers personal vehicle they have the right to record you. Just don't do anything you wouldnt want on camera :)

"Can I ask my Uber driver to NOT record me with his webcam? If I do not want to be recorded, shouldn't I be able to request that?",ToneeJai,18442,CanIaskmyUbe,It all depends which state you live in.

I save footage for 30/60 days and then I get rid of it. I never go home and go over footage for the day unless their was an issue. I have not had to look over any footage to date. I dont have the time and no one that gets into my car is that important to me for me to care to look over it. If someone had an important business call and asked me to turn it off I would be ok with that. ¬†Again you should really save sensitive/private conversation for your home or office.

They have a right not to consent to your conversation however your vehicle is private property. You have a right to end their trip in a safe location early if they don't consent. It's no different than going to the airport and wanting to get on an airplane without going through security. You have an absolute right to refuse the passengers screening but they have an absolute right not to allow you to board that aircraft or remain on Airport property.if you go to any concert venue or any other place that has metal detectors or bag checks and you don't consent to it. They have a right to refuse you admission.A Rideshare driver owns the vehicle that they are using and as long as the security they are doing is lawful. The driver is within his or her right to refuse service for failure to comply with security policies. When you're doing ride-sharing you're out there by yourself and you never know who you're picking up. The sad part is the vast majority of people you serve aren't the ones you have to worry about.

These short-term needs can take many forms, such as medical bills, rent, some big bill that just arose, or even food.¬† Uber/Lyft absolutely lets them do that.Some are getting intangible benefits from driving, such as social validation or psychic rewards.Some find driving to be almost like a game or form of entertainment, learning how to maximize income, finding better rides, mastering surges (haha), and so on.In fact, many drivers are being manipulated by Uber without knowing it. Uber uses very sophisticated psychological technigues to motivate drivers to do what's in Uber's best interests, whether or not it's in the drivers' best interests.In other words, there are many reasons drivers keep driving for Uber or Lyft even though they're not making as much money as they thought they would.Read less..."

It seems to me that people count the opportunity cost of driving as the reason people are not making money. There are times that it appears I am losing money when I am driving, but that is because if I do not have a time frame to be somewhere I will use the app and drive. I do not always get a fare, but when I do it actually offsets the cost of my traveling across town.Another reason is that you can always earn money by choosing to drive more often or around events, so even if you are not earning as much it is possible to make ends meet if you are having monetary difficulty. This is especially true for people who have trouble finding jobs. I do now have a job but I applied for almost a year before I could find work.

There is no way I am going to that hood at 230pm let alone 230am. So I am standing in front of my double parked car with a dog trying to figure out what to do. Some nice people would ask if I was ok some were just a little shady (especially one man who pulled over a block away & watched me for 10 min) All i could here in my head was my dad screaming at me ""are you crazy that time of morning in either of those hoods are you an idiot""? I am sure he was doing flips in his grave. So now I google ""can i call 911 for a stray dog in Phila"" google says yes so it must be ok right. I call 911 operator responds ""I guess you want them to come get dog"" I say well yes i cant leave him roaming the streets. Did I mention dog had an odor that wasnt a good one and was scratching and biting at his skin so I assume he had at the very least fleas, I cant put him in my clean nice smelling Uber or next rider may rate me 1 star for smell.. Now its after 3am I need to get off this corner. I know damn right well every police car in the district is avoiding that intersection like the plague¬† Ten more min. go by I finally see a police car and flag him down. An Officer out of his district (from next district over) must have felt sorry for me or it was Divine Intervention. He gets out of car I explain my dilemma (i all ready have a dog, dont have time for another dog, & most imp. I cant put dirty, smelly, flea ridden dog in my car as I drive for Uber my ratings will drop) He then takes some info from me and takes this beautiful Husky in the back of his car. I was truly grateful. Shout out to Officer Milligan. Only in an Uber.If you enjoy these stories I have plenty more.

A Night In The Life of An Uber Driver! Drivers/Riders please share your story!,momof4,8217,ANightInTheL,"Saturday night I pick up 4 guys in mid to late 20's . First topic of conversation is their friend talking about another friend at a strip club. The friend steals recently deceased grandmother's credit card. Doesnt charge anything worthwhile but goes to strip club and spends 4,000.00 + there. My 1st thought was what an awful grandchild. Next thought is how can you spend that much in one night? I am going to assume maybe he got to take a few strippers home for the night? How much can a lap dance cost? Alcohol? BTW he didnt take any of his friends with him. How rude! Last thought what an idiot. Maybe someone can explain what he spent over 4,000.00 on. He did get caught. Mom had a lot of explaining to do to credit card company. Son has to pay it all back to credit card company. Hope he got something good and memorable that night. Hopefully not an STD.

We pull up to red light and she tells me to go through it. I'm good waiting for the green was my response. She starts talking to me & telling me about the male stripper that someone had ordered for the girl in the back (her bachlorette party). She was complaining how old, saggy, and hairy he was. Then she tells me about the strip club they went to. Apparently the male stripper picked big mouth cop to come up on stage. He asks what type of underwear she had on.? She replies a ""gstring you wanna smell them""? He replies, ""I think we need a new volunteer up here"". She thinks it is hysterical and I guess normal. This goes back and forth about the night¬† at the strip club. We pull up to the bar she gets out and drops the bottle as it shatters and splashes everywhere. Thankfully not in my car. She then proceeds to tell the 5 people standing outside to mind their own business i'm a cop. Wth is wrong with these women? I thought the strippers I picked up were bad. The customers are even worse. I've picked up men from strip clubs and they dont feel the need to tell me about their night at the strip club. Thankfully. Why do people feel the need to tell things like this to their Uber driver? She did hand me a 20.00 tip though. As soon as they exit I get out of there. I take a few rides and its now 2am I get a ride request to pick up at Brick House but name is different from crazy drunk big mouth badge carrying beer dropping cop. I sit for 2 min. and out comes???? You guessed it. It was the even more drunk crazy big mouth badge carrying beer dropping cop. Now bride to be is really drunk looking for a penis straw she dropped. She asks if she can dump her drink out the window. I say go for it as I really dont want alcohol in my car & road was deserted. She decides to wait until 2 cars are behind us and proceeds to throw a drink out the window. Not the alcohol I thought she meant the whole cup with penis straw and alcohol. So of course it hits the car behind us. They pull besides my car yelling and screaming. Drunk crazy cop pulls badge out and slurs ""get out of hear before I have you locked up"". Thankfully it was a group of teens that she was able to scare away with her badge. That was my last ride for the night .

She called me screaming so I drive around to where she told me but there were people all over plus 2 entrances/exits so I ask the first female I see if she was my passenger. She ignores me then I see Mr. Big and Beefy with the tight muscle head shirt on wave me over. She opens door starts screaming why didnt you come here 1st & why were you talking to those people? I try to explain that the pick up location put me up front and what people are you talking about? She screams the people in the car. I reply ""what people, what car"" . She screams again the people in the car. I am getting annoyed now, because she hasnt stopped screaming at me and what people in what car not a clue who she was referring to. I should've left when I was eligible for cancel fee. We drive a mile GPS says make left turn screaming stripper barks order i will tell you where to go. We go another mile another barking order ""pull into that gas station I need something"". She needed something all right some manners or a foot up her ass. I pull in to this gas station that is packed has a line of cars to get in (will explain the line of cars at 3am at a gas station another time). I finally get into lot she gets out and I plot my escape. Why should I take her screaming, order barking ass anywhere else they dont pay me enough for this? I put the car in drive ready to pull out and my guilty conscience kicks in. Its 3am you cant do that. Then the ¬†little devil on my shoulder says go for it. Good conscience won I stayed but when she got back in I had a little talk with her. By the time i dropped her off she was happy. So happy when she got out she said ""i am going to give you 5 stars"". I wanted to reply ""stick your 5 stars so far up (that thing you shake for money)that they shoot out of your mouth and hand over some of those bills you made tonight. ¬†She was out right rude and bossy.The 2nd stripper I picked up didnt yell at me but she also barked orders. Wont get into much detail as I just wrote a book about stripper #1. Her barking orders were hello as she entered car ¬†order #1""put this radio station on, order #2 turn volumn up ill tell you when to stop"" #3 dont speak to me while music is on #4 put the heat up. No please no thank you √†nd you guessed it no tip. Last but not least we pull up to destination my app shows end trip you've arrived i end it wait for her to get the hell out. But she needs to bark 1 more order #5 ""I've never been here before just sit here until I can find my friend then you can leave"". Must be a stripper thing to bark orders and not tip. These 2 were in my first month of driving they taught me a few things that night. ¬†No, one of those things was not how to work a stripper pole. Thanks for sharing R Paulson. Would love to here more stories.Read less..."

A Night In The Life of An Uber Driver! Drivers/Riders please share your story!,momof4,7951,7879,"Maybe she didn't have many lap dances or get many tips that night. After I confronted her in a nice polite way her attitude changed. She said she had a ‚Äùlong night"". She also said all the drivers pick her up in the wrong place (the spot where I went, where the app showed). I wanted to say if you know this why don't you send the drivers's a text. Decided against it didn't want to ruin the mood she was in or make her night longer. I still can't figure out why she was so concerned about me talking to the people in the car (I wasn't ) but she went on about that for a few minutes screaming at me in the beginning of ride. I avoid that area now. Thank you fir your comment."

These programs are still new and are often being rolled out in limited cities or quantities. Here are three areas that you want to explore.¬† Make sure to check the last section on Ride Passes and Commuter Programs.1) Frequent Rider ProgramsUber and Lyfthave both experimented with frequent rider programs, where you are rewarded with free trips or ride credits.¬† We are not aware of any of these being offered consistently, but here are a few links:TechCrunch Article,UberVIP in NYC and Dallas.Fastenis a company that has successfully implemented a frequent rider program. This generous program offers credits for future rides and are applied to all riders automatically.¬† Currently, they are offering $5 credit for taking 10 rideshttps://fasten.com/us/karma2) Prepaid Gift CardsUber and Lyft offer prepaid gift cards, and they are available at major retailers.¬† Check out this link to find out stores where they are available.Uber Gift Cards.Occasionally, these retailers offer discounts so you may want to look out for them.¬† You may also be able to buy them through gift exchange/trade programs at a site likeGiftCardZen.

This may also be a way to save a few percentages on Uber rides.3) ""Ride Passes"" or Commuter PassesBoth Uber and Lyft have offered passes and pre-paid cards in the past.¬† ¬†The one for Uber is called ""Ride Pass"" and the one for Lyft is called ""Lyft Line Pass.""¬† Unfortunately, they are only offered in limited quantities and for Lyft, I am not sure if they offer this anymore.¬† (If I find out more, I will update this post.)Lyft - ""Lyft Line Pass""- One option (Option 1) is to pay $20 upfront and every ride will be $2 for that month.¬† The other option (Option 2) is to pay $29 upfront and all the rides are covered.¬† This no longer seems ot be available, but here's a link to a past blog post:https://blog.lyft.com/posts/now-on-sale-membership-passes-for-novemberUber - ""Ride Pass""- In exchange for an upfront fee, Uber guarantees the price or at least the discout for all the rides within that month. The price and discounts depend on the city, but in oneexample, a rider paid $12 upfront and paid $3.49 for UberPools (capped at $15) and $6.99 UberXs (capped at $20).¬† If the price of the ride is higher than the cap, the rest is must be paid by the rider.¬† So, this is a great deal!What is Ride Pass - More information from UberSign up and Check Availability BelowThis program as we understand is limited to limited cities and limited in quantity.¬† Some report that invitations are being sent to a sample group of current users.¬† Here's a list created by Jing from thisblog.San FranciscoNew YorkLos AngelesSan DiegoBostonChicagoMiamiSeattleWashington D.C.DenverDallasHoustonAtlantaPhoenixAustinNew Orleansippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Apr 28, 2018"

All of your solutions are app (Uber/Lyft) based. How about the option where the driver makes a daily arrangement to carry a rider to work or school, many times at a discount rate of 10% because the driver keeps the other 15% he would be paying Uber.

(Uber told CNN Business this was an automated response sent in error.) He called driver support, which indicated that agents were unavailable during the weekend.

Let's say someone asked for an extra salsa for their party and chips and salsa are free and are given right as you are seated. Let's also add on to this scenario and say it's super busy as well. So the table asks for an extra salsa, gets the one but the server forgot or maybe the kitchen forgot to ring in or serve the extra dish of salsa. Most people would shrug it off and maybe just ask again or not as they would notice it's super busy, but you get a lady who is just so pissed the server didn't bring the extra salsa. That lady will ask to speak with me and she will bitch about it and I'd most likely comp a meal or something, but the lady takes it to a whole other level and contacts corporate to complain. Let's go back and see, the server who was waiting on them is a 18 year old single mom who works 3 jobs to support herself and her child and takes classes every night at the community college. She depends on this job, but you get this lady who bitches to corporate, I get a call from corporate giving me an order to reprimand the employee and fire her... People will complain about the smallest, most petty crap. They're the world's most selfish ¬†people and not once did that lady think about why maybe it was forgotten or maybe it was so busy that the salsa ticket was in, but because of the busy-ness, it had yet to reach the window. None of that crossed her mind. She did not ONCE think about how her actions (complaining) about such a small thing would impact the waitress and because of the ladys selfishness, that server is now down a job, can't afford rent, can't afford school or day care, etc.I live in a very afuent area. The county I live in is the richest in the whole country and rich white folk (I'm white as well, not that it matters) run rampant here and the scenario I just described, happened on the daily, if not multiple times a day.

How can I specify a female driver?,PFontanetta,9167,9084,That‚Äôs a fantastic point about how Uber knows your location.
How can I specify a female driver?,momof4,9172,9167,It seems pointless to go through Uber app when you can just call 911.

I live in Philly 4 blocks away from Bucks County. When I call 911 from my cell I get Bensalem (Bucks County) I have to tell why I called only to be told to hold on while they contact Philly and transfer the call. Its frustrating in an emergency. If you go through the Uber app they know your exact location and give it to police radio 911.
How can I specify a female driver?,LG-PA,9206,9172,The reason Bensalem police dispatch wants to boot you to Philly is most likely because they want to keep their crime rate stats down:) As if you report a crime in a particular town it goes against theoir record (at least I think so)

With a blonde wig and frilly light green Summer skirt she was quite the showman. Sparkling eyes and plump full lips slathered with a rich red lipstick made her provocative. She was talkative and flirtatious. She laughed with a stifled giggle that captured the moment. We talked for about 20 minutes about her being a cheerleader in high school and now in college driving Uber to make a little extra money. Regina turned and with a slight tilt of her head, her life story came tumbling out. It was a tale of abuse and addictions. Families laid waste. A captivating tale. The angled tilt of her head revealed a startling piece of information about this nubile leader of cheers. Regina had an adam‚Äôs apple.

Uber Deactivation for Safety Concerns,npriddy,UberDeactiva,0,"This week I was three weeks from my two year anniversary with Uber. I have a 4.94 rating (490 5 star, 4 4 star, 6 1 star) and I have done over 4800 rides. I have had no accidents, only one ticket over a year and a half ago and it was my word against the officers (yellow light/officer said red). I never cancel on riders other than no-shows or extreme conditions such as the car breaking down. I almost always beat the time given on the app - I never pause when going to get a passenger. I felt I was doing the best any driver could possibly do. I go out of my way to help my passengers. This last week I get this message on my app that said ""Account needs attention"" and something like ""Please contact support"". When I tried to go online Friday night it wouldn't let me. 24 hours later I get a response. ""During a recent review, we noted that your account is associated with multiple reports of safety concerns. You were previously notified that repeated reports of this nature could lead to loss of access to Uber apps. As a result, your account has been deactivated."" I questioned them an they just kept up with the same basic response and wouldn't tell what the safety concerns were. I only know of one complaint back in May where a rider complained I didn't wear a mask, but that NEVER happened. I wore my mask religiously. At the time I tried handling it but was ignored. It was a false report. I am deactivated and have been completely cut off now. In my mind I think someone at Uber decided to get rid of some drivers in this area and fired me and used ""safety concerns"" as a reason. I don't believe this had anything to do with safety concerns. Anyone else experiencing this?"

No accidents, my background checks are all clear, my documents are all up to date, it makes no sense. My wife thinks it's because of the free tuition. I had been Platinum, but when the pandemic hit I basically stopped doing Uber except here and there. My last trip was 3 weeks ago. The wife says they're cleaning house, probably. Whatever. I'm mostly over it. But to add insult to injury they banned me fromordering food or rides.I never order rides, but food I do on occasion.

"What is the ""cleaning fees"" and ""vomit"" SCAM by Uber drivers? Should I be concerned? How do I avoid them?","ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLC",ippei1202Ube,"Whatisthe""cl","Cleaning Fee is disputed often. Some are blatant scams. Some are in gray areas.The ""cleaning fee scam"" is when an Uber driverfabricatesorexaggeratesdamages to their vehicle in order to collect a large cleaning fee.Drivers can collect anywhere from $20 to $150 an incident by reporting damages to Uber. ¬†(or more, if a professional help is needed and there is a receipt.) ¬†The driver needs to submit a photo evidence directly to Uber. The cleaning fees are charged back to the offending customer.Fabrication:In some scams, the Uber driver simply makes up an incident by reporting food spills or bodily fluids soiling the car. ¬†Since a photo is required, the driver would create an artificial mess and snap a pic. ¬† Some are known to simply submit a photo they find on the Internet. ¬†(Some drivers have shared with us that fake barfs and water bottles are used to make up a mess.)Exaggeration: In some cases, the passengers do make some mess.¬† Some drivers take advantage of this by artificially making the mess bigger or simply exaggerating it on the claims form to Uber.¬† There are four levels of cleaning fees, and if they can bump it up, they can earn more money. (related:How much are cleaning fees? - 4 Levels)Why does this work?This scam often works for multiple reasons. ¬†One common reason is that the passenger may not notice they were charged the fee. Uber is extremely simple to use, where a credit card is automatically charged and the receipt is sent to the Inbox. ¬†Many people do not bother checking those receipts or the amount charged. ¬†If you do not notice? ¬†The driver just got away.The passenger may also not remember the incident clearly, and it can become the driver's word against passenger's word. ¬†If you fell asleep or were intoxicated, you may not remember well and you may have a difficult time arguing and making your case to Uber. ¬† This can also happen when there are multiple passengers where the person who was charged cannot remember if a friend had made a mess.When a driver exaggerates the damage, it is difficult to catch for the passenger. ¬†For example, if you spilled your drink, it may have been a simple clean up at $20. ¬†However, the driver can claim a larger damage, say on the upholstery, where a professional cleaning was performed at $80.How to avoid and what to do when you suspect a scam.As a passenger, you want to be diligent by reviewing every Uber receipt to make sure a fake cleaning fee was not assessed.¬† If you indeed created a mess, you want to check whether the charge is fitting of the damage caused.¬† Take a look at the different cleaning fees assessed:How much are cleaning fees? - 4 Levels.If you do suspect a fraud/scam, you want to contact Uber immediately and make your case.

What's the biggest lie that a mechanic has ever told you?,JMartensen,7699,7586,"If the timing chain or belt was gone, your engine and its pistons inside would fall apart. Your car would be dead on the side of the road.Good for you to have known that.¬† I am not sure if that's a common knowledge.¬† To think that this mechanic may have gotten away with it with others makes me really mad.BTW, I feel like $10,000 repair should be a red-flag on its own.¬† Removing and replacing timing belt is a huge pain, of course, and requires lots of hours.¬† If the engine is busted, sure, maybe more labor.¬† However, $10,000 on what I assume to be a 10+ year old car (I am assuming), it just ridiculous.¬† Might as well total the car and move on."
What's the biggest lie that a mechanic has ever told you?,SyedAli,7567,What'sthebig,"Every time I take my car in, they tell me my brakes are shot.¬† When I point out any sound my car makes they always tell me it's the brakes and they tell me to replace it.¬† Yeah, I get it.¬† I drive a lot now, but the # of pads that I go through is insane."
What's the biggest lie that a mechanic has ever told you?,fpressly,7606,7567,"If you are gong through that many brake pads you need to look to other things to be the cause. One contributor could be the rotor (if these are disk brakes). If the rotor is worn one side more than the other or deep grooves can be seen in the surface, that¬†will wear some pads out quick. I seldom have my rotors turned ($15) because it cost 3/4 of cost of a new one. $20 for a new rotor and a like new braking experience. Make sure your hand brake is disengaged."

But they always make it a ppint to recommend a bunch of services I do not need :). Check this out: I went to Autozone and put new set of wiper blades, then drove across the street to Firestone to get oil changed. 1 hour later I get a call from Firestone with a recommendation to put on new wiper blades.

another could be 1.5x or even regular pricing. ¬†What some passengers will do is move¬†the pin around until they get out of a surge zone and then make their request. ¬†At that point, they‚Äôll either call the driver and let them know their real address or wait for the driver to pick them up and tell them ‚Äúthe GPS must be wrong‚Äù.I‚Äôve been noticing this hack¬†with greater frequency over the

cancel as a no-show to make sure that I get the cancellation fee. ¬†I‚Äôll also turn on my other app at this point and¬†try to get another request during that 5 minute waiting period.2) Dropping the Pin Outside of Airport PremisesThis is a slight variation of the above hack but since there is a geo-fence around some airports, a lot of passengers have figured out that you can just drop the pin outside of the geo-fence (where lots of drivers are waiting) and then request that the driver come into the terminal and get you.There is no risk for the passenger with this strategy but the driver could face fines and possible impound if they get busted. ¬†Lyft and Uber have been very good about covering fees in this situation but I‚Äôve heard that they are going to¬†slowly phase out that policy. ¬†So drivers beware.How to Avoid: Don‚Äôt go into the airports (unless pick-ups are ok at your local airport) to pick anyone up. ¬†Let the passenger know why you can‚Äôt come get them, ask them to cancel the ride and take a shuttle outside the airport (and don‚Äôt forgot to¬†tell them¬†to tip the shuttle driver a $1 or $2 for the ride3) Lyftjacking Or Uberjacking (Stealing other people's rides)I‚Äôve readlots of storiesabout this one happening to unsuspecting drivers and it basically involves a passenger trying to¬†steal someone else‚Äôs Lyft or Uber ride. ¬†These ‚Äòhackers‚Äô will sometimes just get into your car if they see trade dress and let you know where they‚Äôre going. ¬†5 minutes later you‚Äôll get a call from your real passenger asking ‚ÄúWhere the F are you going?!‚Äù ¬†At this point, you‚Äôre in a tough situation because you‚Äôve already started the trip on the wrong person and now you have someone in your car who you‚Äôre going to have to let out. ¬†Just make sure that you‚Äôre as diplomatic as possible if this happens and e-mail support ASAP once you end the ride.How to Avoid: I always ask the passenger to confirm their name instead of saying, ‚ÄúHey are you Steve?‚Äù ¬†Especially during surge times¬†orat the end of an eventwhen there are lots of people looking for their rides, it‚Äôs imperative that you find the right person. ¬†I also turn on my flashers and try to make it easy for the right passenger to find me.4) Uber/Lyft RaceThere are some passengers who will call an Uber and a Lyft at the same time and take whichever car arrives first. ¬†I know because this has happened to me before as a driver. ¬†I pulled up at a location and saw passengers getting into another driver‚Äôs car and shortly after, the ride was cancelled.Uber and Lyft need to do a better job of punishing riders who cancel or abuse the system. ¬†I don‚Äôt think there are many passengers that do this but it would be nice to see some repercussions for people who take advantage of drivers like this.5) Canceling A Trip During The RideI‚Äôve never personally experienced this but I‚Äôve talked to many drivers who have¬†had passengers cancel the trip halfway through or even as soon as the ride begins. ¬†If drivers aren‚Äôt looking at their phone, then they might not even know that this has happened until they get to the destination.How To Avoid: I always use the GPS on my phone to navigate even if I am pretty sure where we‚Äôre going. ¬†That also means that I‚Äôll see¬†a cancellation notification/text every time I glance at the phone. ¬†Just make sure that you don‚Äôt do it while you‚Äôre driving.The above is 5 out of the 10 from Harry's article.¬† Read morehere.Read less..."

Is Uber eats worth it for drivers?,"ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLC",ippei1202Ube,IsUbereatswo,"DependsI will let other drivers on the forum answer this, but here are some comments:Are you a driver looking for more gigs? Then sure.Drivers can receive both ride requests and food delivery requests on the same shift. Therefore, drivers can keep busy by accepting both regular requests and Uber EATS requests.¬† It is a good way to increase the incoming requests.Are you a driver who is already keeping busy with rides?If the driver's shift is already busy picking up regular rides, he or she may opt out of Uber Eats requests that has a different pay scale.¬† The rates are calculated in a similar fashion to regular rides but they are different.¬† Drivers have to do the math which job to focus their shift on.Is it worth the hassle? Gotta watch pickup/delivery policiesSee, the time is of the essence to a Uber driver.¬† Unlike regular rides, the drivers need to consider for the time lost during pickups and making the deliveries. Every market has a different policy but some instruct the drivers to go to the doors for pickup/delivery while some encourage customers to meet the driver curbside. This definitely will play into the drivers preferring UberEATS.UPDATE:We had a few drivers share with us that Uber Eats requests are usually short-distance trips, always less than a few miles. Since drivers are getting paid for the time/distance driven, they do not make that much money on each request, and when considering the time spent on picking up and dropping off, it seems this is a less desired Uber service by the drivers.ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Mar 25, 2018"

The rider ( I cannot figure out which one) who reported me for car being dirty and bad odor and apparently (according to email from Uber)I needed to shower.¬† This pops up as a report a few weeks ago while driving on a Friday night. I lost it. I cancelled my rider pulled over and sent Uber some of the most nastiest emails to date (trust me I have sent some pretty bad ones) I was shocked when I was able to get back on the app¬† in the morning. I thought for sure I would be deactivated. I sent screenshots of my car, pics of the air freshners I use. I do not since the 6th grade leave my home unless I am showered, hair washed daily, make up on and clothes are never worn more than once before they are washed. My kids think I am OCD when it comes to wash and cleaning. My clothes have to smell like fabric softner when I put them on or they go back into the wash. Lol I will also mention I use deodorant. I am in Nursing school which thry dont tolerate bad hygeine and I work in hospital where I cant smell either.¬† I wouldve been less angry if they reported I was falling alseep at the wheel (although I dont do that either). I was so furious I retired for the night after 3 rides. Texting this story is making me angry all over again. Lol I went back and forth with Uber for about 7 emails from me 3 from them. How dare they believe 1 rider report assume they are telling the truth. I hope their dumb simple minded asses didnt refund this piece of shit rider. There was more bad language used. Language I never use.¬† Dont think its a good idea to put certain words up on this site lol They email me back saying they dont always believe rider especially since there are no other reports but they are just trying to help me with telling me what rider said and give me suggestions. Wait you just said you didnt necessarily believe them but now your suggesting air freshner and better hygiene again. I finally gave up. Told them what I thought about rider, report, and their responses and called it a night. Nothing has pissed me off more than thst night. So wish I knew who it was. I had no issues with any rider other than the foot fetish guy who wanted to know about my shoes and a guy who said he left his cheap throw away cell in my car which was not in my car (I even checked gas station/mini mart I took him to to make sure they didnt have it).I had few rides that week and only drove 2 days.

Can Uber and Lyft Fully Recover from the Pandemic? [RideshareGuy],SmittenKitten,CanUberandLy,0,"From the RideshareGuy:Uber and Lyft have been offering drivers big incentives to hit the road, mainly because of the driver shortage, but is that enough to entice drivers to return to the platform?One of my biggest concerns for the rideshare industry is the yo-yo effect on drivers: drivers returning to the platform or joining it for the first time, making good money, then having demand dry up due to shutdowns nationwide.If that happens too many times, fewer drivers will see rideshare driving as a viable option to earn extra income - and that will really spell problems for the rideshare industry.Here‚Äôs what readers are saying:Jerri shares a common sentiment among drivers: not wanting to return to rideshare due to too many concerns about unvaccinated and potentially sick passengers:‚ÄúI'm slowly getting back to doing food delivery. At this point I'm not sure if I'm going back to regular Uber with all the rate and vaccine issues.‚ÄùAnother driver believes the shortage can be attributed to people having more money and not necessarily needing to drive:‚ÄúIt's almost like the 40% of the market that was doing this gig before Covid now don't have a reason to get back in.

In a city like Chicago there a many alternatives to the private vehicle and almost all are more convenient, affordable, and relaxing. I can think of few less productive or more wasteful and depressing modes of commute than sitting in gridlock twice a day, an hour or two each way.In the last few years companies like Zipcar and iGo have presented alternatives to private car ownership. Rent a car for errands, then park and walk away. Simple. The proliferation of ride-sharing services like Lyft, Uber X, and Hailo also point to a new enthusiasm for escaping from the ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù of being shackled to one's own vehicle. Drivers want to be compensated for being stuck with these hunks of metal and who can blame them? The Divvy bike-sharing program has, by most accounts, been a big success and new bike lanes seem to appear around the city every other week. All these developments point to a tidal shift in how residents think about getting around their city.One of the key benefits and pleasures of city life is the chance to interact with others. The private automobile is antithetical to that idea. It's a closed environment which only comes into contact with other similarly closed environments when they conflict. A traffic jam is rarely the place to make friends. Cars are mainly obstacles to other cars. This is not to say that pedestrians and bicyclists spend their days dancing jigs and spoiling one another with group hugs but that when they near one another there aren't yards of metal, plastic and glass separating them. As unpleasant as an overcrowded city bus may be, it's certainly less alienating than thousands of vehicles on a highway, each with one occupant, each going their own way.They say that forward-thinking industrialists are investing in driverless vehicles and they can't get here fast enough for my taste. I can't wait to relinquish the control, but also the stress, worry and expense that comes along with my car keys. Any time I leave the house and take the Metra or the CTA rather than the car, the world feels like a lighter and more enjoyable place to be. With all the alternatives available these days, I hope never to buy my own automobile again. A car-free future would be a beautiful future indeed.Read less..."

My Post-Driving Life [Dmitry Samarov],Samarov,5715,5710,"Hard to compare. Boston was a lot harder to learn in terms of geography. No straight streets and a lot of one-ways in the opposite direction to what you need. I was in my mid-20s driving there and it seemed like an adventure.

We would call and they'd tell us to come pick them up at a certain time. (No online orders back then.) I think we used to give them 2 hours or something.Seeing how this was never an issue for the stores, we feel like we learned important lessons:- Those McDonald's store freezers store heck of a lot more than 200 patties and buns. They must have 1000s delivered at once.- The world is a big place. Thinking how many customers visit a single location in a day (plus the drive-thru), we realized they must serve 100s of burgers (maybe even 1000+) a day during those lunches and dinner times. Ordering 200 didn't even faze them."

Explaining the rating system,DougH,7807,Explainingth,Very accurate. I try to do my part by telling friends that anything less than 5 is basically signaling that the driver should be fired.

Explaining the rating system,MaryIST,13409,7807,"Oh, boy. ¬†Are you sure this is really the case? I have never wished upon a driver he be fired but I have given some four-star ratings. I am starting to feel real bad for this. I thought I was being constructive to be honest."
Explaining the rating system,DougH,13430,13409,"I wouldn't really worry about it. It would take a lot of 4-star ratings to badly harm the driver's overall rating. If there was a pretty major issue, 4-stars or less is appropriate. I usually only downrate for safety problems, or extreme unprofessionalism."
Explaining the rating system,RIDEINFO,19014,7807,"This is true. ¬†Some people give lower ratings just because they don't want to give a 5, even if there was nothing wrong with the ride."

Explaining the rating system,KristenJanetKim,8238,8226,I often check my ratings right after a passenger gets dropped off. I got it immediately after the ride ended and it was my first 3-star rating.
Explaining the rating system,duckdomination,9225,8040,"Yup. ¬†The only less than 5 stars I have gotten are due to Lyft app issues. ¬†I‚Äôm currently 4.99 due to the app sending me around the block with 3 riders yesterday. ¬†I complained to Lyft and they blew me off and said ‚Äúfocus on the positive‚Äù.

Anything that's not a driver or a car issue, then only a five star counts, anything less is not counted against you. I'm a 4.93 and about 74% rate me, meaning in reality 26% of people had a bad ride with me but Uber took the blame because they selected a none driver issue."
Explaining the rating system,Bigfrank,7884,Explainingth,Stars are for children in kindergarten and for adults who act like kindergarten children.
Explaining the rating system,KristenJanetKim,7886,7884,"LOL! Why can‚Äôt the rating system be like UberEats, thumbs up or down? Thumbs up, you would want that driver or passenger again. Thumbs down, no. Then the driver would need to maintain a minimum percentage of thumbs up to stay active. For UberEats it‚Äôs 85%."
Explaining the rating system,amcbeth,8225,7886,"1. Has anyone ever calculated what they make on UberEats? I have, thumbs down.2. What is the difference between adding Thumbs and the current rating system.I would imagine most of the customers for UberEats would give a thumbs down and the rest wouldn't rate.I¬†also think Uber would never let a driver go that does UberEats, there are so few."
Explaining the rating system,KristenJanetKim,8239,8225,"I currently have 95%. The app says you need to maintain 85% in order to keep delivering with UberEats. Pay is lousy. I average $6 per delivery (vs. $10 per delivery with DoorDash). But the advantage is the trips are usually short and it‚Äôs a good way to get to your Quest bonus faster, not to mention it‚Äôs a restroom break. Plus I‚Äôve discovered a lot of great restaurants for myself this way."
Explaining the rating system,SteveBausch,13411,7886,Is this true that UberEats only offer Thumbs up and Thumbs down?
Explaining the rating system,jeremyalastor,7988,7886,"I didn't realize that this is how Uber eats does ratings. So much easier. Come on Uber, you already do this on one of your platforms, it would be so easy to implement!"
Explaining the rating system,KristenJanetKim,8000,7988,"The current system of rating is so flawed because passengers don‚Äôt understand it. I even gave a driver 3 stars once because he had a hard time finding me in spite of calling me. This was before I became a driver. Now I realize it‚Äôs often not the driver‚Äôs fault because Google Maps or Waze may take the driver to an alternate entrance, or may have the wrong address to begin with."
Explaining the rating system,GundamX10,8460,8000,"Yes, but it's still the fact that he was late and couldn't find you.¬† He can't just blame the technology, and it still reflects on his overall ability to pick up passengers.¬†¬†An experienced driver may have beenThe rating shouldn't just be about the intention or the blame, or else any nice driver will have prefect scores.¬† It should be on a person's ability as a rideshare driver."
Explaining the rating system,SteffGart24,7811,Explainingth,"Very nice.¬† This needs to be placed in every doctor's office.¬† I mean in every Uber cabinI disagree on one thing though.¬† Passenger's take on 1-star?¬† I think that's more for- ""My driver was drunk"" or- ""Dropped me off in¬† middle of a highway.or, my favorite- ""I just didn't like the guy."""
Explaining the rating system,KristenJanetKim,7828,7811,There are a lot of reasons a passenger may give 1 star. I got 1 star because a passenger was 5 minutes late to work and blamed it on me. It was also a Pool with 2 other passengers on board. I also got 1 star because the destination filter failed to give me a ride going my direction. I had to ask the 2nd Pool passenger to get another Uber because he was going the opposite direction I was. I had a kid ride scheduled and you can‚Äôt cancel a kid last minute. I bet the guy got another Uber within minutes. I also got a fare adjustment because he probably complained and asked for a refund.Another time I got a police officer as a passenger. It was literally a 1-mile ride. I got 3 stars from him. The only mistake I made was not turning in the correct driveway for his hotel. I corrected it. Nobody was in any kind of danger. I felt that was an unfair rating.
Explaining the rating system,SteffGart24,7891,7828,"Why can't we all just get along.¬† Empathize with each other, and help each other out.¬† We are all in this together.¬† Such a bummer that the dude gave you one-star for that.The police officer probably just thought 3 was ""normal"".¬† People in those professions (like military) don't sugarcoat things, and I bet he probably thought he was giving ""average."""
Explaining the rating system,RIDEINFO,19013,7811,"So true. ¬†I get riders who take their time getting to the car,then want me to break speed limits because they are late for work. ¬†Has nothing to do with how long it took me to get to them. ¬†Also, Uber often sends you to a ride 15-20 minutes away. ¬†Cant believe there is no one closer. ¬†The rider gets mad because it took you that long to get there,"
Explaining the rating system,breakingbread,7821,Explainingth,This is so great! It is sad but true.
Explaining the rating system,Karajoe,7764,Explainingth,"This is so accurate! It's bad that I laughed a little bit, but passengers don't understand what their ratings mean to drivers. Rate 5 stars people!"
Explaining the rating system,FlutterShy,7810,Explainingth,"HAAAHAAAHAA.¬† This is dead on!!!¬† Super funny.¬† I particularly love how the 4-star goes to ""Driver needs to be terminated.¬† Well, that escalated quickly!!!"

I've only received 469 ratings out of 905 trips. One 1-star, 13 3s, 10 4s, and 435 5s. What did I do wrong on those 24 trips? I'll never know because no feedback is required..."

More important are the written comments people have taken the time to make. Giving star ratings is a momentary off the cuff reaction. Written comments take time and thought.I think the driver and the rider should have two choices, 1. I WILL ride with this person again. 2. I WILL NOT ride with this person again. Then let the computer do the rest to match appropriate combinations of rider/driver. Either you are willing to deal with this person again or you are not. That is all that should matter. If enough drivers say they will not deal with a rider that rider is banned. If 20‚Äì25 riders in a certain time frame say they won‚Äôt ride with this driver again; sorry bro, we got to investigate that. 25 strangers can‚Äôt all be liars. Time for corrective measures.While I am at it, I would like to mention to those of you who are interested in driving for Uber or Lyft and are enticed by the bonuses for signing up and delivering a certain number of rides in a set time frame. Beware. Make sure the geographic area where you are working IS ABLE TO DELIVER THE NUMBER OF CALLS NECESSARY for you to achieve that goal (factor in the saturation of drivers in that city). When I first signed up for Lyft in Greenville SC I was only getting 3‚Äì4 calls a day (in an afternoon six hour shift) and didn‚Äôt even get close to enough rides for the sign on bonus. Still unsure if that was low demand or if Lyft was choking back my ridership so I could not make bonus.Adding Uber boosted me to 25 calls a day. 25‚Äì30 rides a day is average. During a Clemson home game, my busiest day ever, in one 24 shift I delivered 58 rides. My best day was $850. The rider, on a long haul, agreed to pay twice the Uber for an empty return and gave me a $100 tip. It was a 12 hour excursion.Thanks for your upvote.Read less..."

By now you've figured out they are not delivering free lunches to the needy. Given the anonymity of Uber vehicles (without livery) your vehicle is an ideal tool for criminals.

People who say they are risk averse and are worried about being sued have no backbone. Anytime I can help another human being, particularly in a life and death situation I am going to step up. It's just in my nature. I don‚Äôt think of it as a ‚Äúdriver‚Äù issue so much as a responsible citizen issue."

How are you supposed to even get leverage at 6 inches? I think we have become a people of AAA reliants. My 328i doesn't even have a spare tire. Have a car problem, call a car service.Almost two weeks ago I was tooling down the highway and Waze told me there was a car ahead on the shoulder. As I approached I punched the Waze update that said the car was still here and slowed to assess the situation. It was a Toyota Corolla, probably 6 -8 years old, the brightest key lime pie green imaginable and with what had to be the largest African American woman I had ever personally seen, standing forlornly by a tire so flat it had come half way off the tire. I mean I don‚Äôt know how to exactly put it in words except to say SHE WAS BIG in allcaps. There may be larger women on TV but this was the largest I had ever seen with my own eyes. She was holding the little 6 inch lug wrench they give you, as though that were the culprit to her problem. Little did she know she would never get to the lug wrench portion of that affair. Her real problem was in the fact that the low profile tires she had, made it too low (with a flat) to get her OEM jack underneath it.¬† She would have been here a while. Without further discussion I saw the problem and moved to fix it. I backed the limo up jumped in the Corolla to lock the brakes and make sure it was in park. I felt like a kid in his Dad‚Äôs chair. The seat had been removed from it‚Äôs bolt downs and moved all the way back to the back seat and rebolted. The passenger side seat had also been moved back and shifted left. This essentially made two seats into one. There was no leg room for anyone in the back seat. The woman explained she sat in the middle of the front seat (one butt cheek per seat), drove with her left hand and shifted and did everything else with her right hand. I was amazed at the woman‚Äôs tenacity in wanting to be self-sufficient in transportation. Needless to say I made swift work of her tire change. The woman tried to tip me, but that would have taken away the pleasure of just doing a good deed for a person with an unsolvable problem. Just give them that little hand up, that little nudge.

Two min. go by pool ride request 4.5 rating 15 min. away, 3 more min go by pool request 20 min. away 4.5 rating.

Probably a new driver picks him/her up and they say "" i dont understand I couldnt get anyone to take my request"" dont be a D Bag and treat people nice and maybe that wouldnt happen. It just felt good to finally see this happen. Uber wont have to deactivate, drivers are sticking together not tolerating bad behavior on crappy pool rides. Although person shoukd be deactivated with that rating.My happiness was short lived though. Now that I cant see my cancel or acceptance rate( although i dont think its that bad) think I am on some kind of time out or punishment. Not sure if its from that or from the class action suit I got 123.45 from a few days ago. Friday night averaged 38.50 an hr. had a long trip and a few good cash tips. Saturday and Sunday night awful.

"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",ChrisWeston,9629,9536,"That's neat that the surge kept creeping up, and you were able to keep it. (So you got a 8.25X surge? Wow.)I wonder what it's like from the eyes of a customer though. One can be in an area where there is no surge, but depending on where the driver came from he can be dinged with inflated prices.Also, does the surge earned by the driver stick forever? It must not. A customer shouldn't be dinged with a surge from an hour ago when the roads were busy. So many questions."
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",momof4,9647,9629,"I was wondering about that also. Next time I will look at the ride after the surge. See if rider pays or Uber takes loss. On the map you can see the amt. the closer you get to where the 8.25 (or whatever the amt. is) it keeps creeping up. It shows you the changes of surge amt. under the words ""finding trips"". I started at Knights & Frankford as I travelled it started saying minimum surge 1.25 (as I travel closer to that 8.25 it just keeps going up) 2.50 etc. I hit knights and fairdale 8.25 popped up.

Next time I will look at the ride after the surge. See if rider pays or Uber takes loss. On the map you can see the amt. the closer you get to where the 8.25 (or whatever the amt. is) it keeps creeping up. It shows you the changes of surge amt. under the words ""finding trips"". I started at Knights & Frankford as I travelled it started saying minimum surge 1.25 (as I travel closer to that 8.25 it just keeps going up) 2.50 etc. I hit knights and fairdale 8.25 popped up.

I can honestly say some of the riders I pick up I dont understand why their ratings are low. I have no issues with them other than they may not tip. I dont rate less than 5 stars for not tipping thats just me. Other drivers feel differently so your Uncle will have to decide. Out of 1475 I've never rated anyone below a 5. There has been a handful or 2 that I probably should have. No one has annoyed me that much :) I also stay away from dangerous neighborhoods. Obviously I have trips to these neighborhoods which I do drop off but I shut the app off until I get closer to my area. Streets are very small, trolley tracks, etc just too much stress not worth it. My experience is for the most part they dont cancel drivers for ratings. BTW I drive in Philadelphia and Bucks County. When I first started I knew nothing nor did I bother to look things up. I managed but I've learned a lot through sites like this and you tube videos lol. I watched them waiting for rides.I learned which ones were a waste and which ones were worth taking advice. ¬†The only thing I disagree with is having water and snacks. Gum and mints are ok but also not necessary at leastbin my experience. Its recommended by some ride share bloggers, videos, etc... Had them in beginning. Anyone who took them which was rare never tipped, dont know about the ratings. I can tell you my ratings didnt get better or worse bit having them. BTW it was always pool people they took them and some for later. I guess it cant hurt though. If its real hot I have some water. Snacks and candy I do for holidays. Gum and mints isnt a bad idea. When I do have those I buy for myself. I offer to passengers that are nice. I can tell you chargers are great to have. I carry android, iphone, galaxy note 8 that has different chargers than all others. What works great is an aux cord riders love it. Had riders tip decent amounts. I also have you tube red 10.00 a month (think u can deduct on taxes but not 100% sure) I can play anything they want. I also create a few play list ex.rock, classic rock metal most of my riders like this one (even young ones) 80''s music, oldies 50's and 60's, rap(not hard core)young people post malone, wiz kalifa, chris brown,. I've got great tips for this also. Usually pays for itself. Thats what works for me here in Philly and Bucks. This site is great for getting ideas, suggestions, info ¬†etc....Hope this helps. Once your Uncle drives more it should get better. Stay away from pool if possible. Now that I wrote you a novel hope something I posted helps and answers your questions. As you can see my answers are always long and probably more info than you wanted. ¬†Lol If there is anything else feel free to ask. I'll answer as best as possible.

"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",momof4,9565,9558,I have both up. Was in Center City a few weeks ago for an appointment.

Uber decided to re route back to streets we all ready were on in beginning of trip. Then Uber app froze and crashed. I had shut down Waze had to get it back up but was at greenlight with traffic behind no time. I ended up turning into hotel parking lot by city hall instead of not knowing which way to go or endangering passengers until I fixed issues. ¬†Its CC traffic heavy around city hall people drive like idiots. I panicked. Lol I had 4 riders who were lets say somewhat snobby. You know the type they have money your just a driver who doesnt ¬†matter. ¬†it seemed like they were getting annoyed.

Not sure how drivers use Waze, but I disable voice and turn by turn screens. I only have the map up and the banner on top that tells me in how many miles I am to take my next turn and onto what road.If you follow the map you can see the contour of the street you are driving on, you can count how many streets more until the one you need, etc.Read less..."

I don‚Äôt know for sure but some areas like Cape Cod, Outer Banks, and Jersey Shore I always think they must drive long ways to pick up passengers because they‚Äôre big areas.For trips over 20 minutes (or anything over 8 miles or something) you get long pickup fees. They never seem to be what they make it out to be though.We are supposed to get paid mile and distance, but they must only apply to the part that‚Äôs considered as ‚Äúlong‚Äù and not the entire pickup trip. Some I‚Äôve collected were like $3 and $8. ¬†I‚Äôve heard from others they received amount in the pennies."
"Pay backs for bad behavior, being a jerk to your Uber driver",momof4,9551,9549,I get long pick ups in the city also usually 12 or 20 min. Lately I've got a few for 9 min. Yes they are usually under 2.00. The higher ones I got were only because of surge. It seems like the fee only kicks in when you actually take 12 or 20 min to get there. When first started I would get there before allotted time and wouldnt get a dime. Other times I notice them is when i am in surged area. Those drivers probably left where they to try to catch surge and then those areas were short. Before new app i would be in surged area but would get long pickups put of surge. New one is actually helps me.

I'd usually take the passenger to their home anyway‚Äìwhich really makes me the chump but I feel better about myself. Well, there was no indication of her eventual destination so I stopped and it all began.""Why are you stopping here? This isn't my home!""""Because this is an ExpressPool and right here is where I'm supposed to drop you off.""It escalated from there. I even pulled the car around and began to head to her home but she wouldn't (or couldn't) tell me where to go. Then she started to shout at me and, I'll admit it, I flared up and said, ""Don't yell at me, ma'am. Not when I'm doing you a favor!""It got a bit worse from there and I told her to get out‚Äìshe didn't‚Äìand then she told me to stop and she would walk. Then I stopped a bit too fast. I thought she'd close the back-door‚Äìshe didn't‚Äìand then she threw something at the car. At first, I thought it was a rock or something damaging but when I opened the door, it turned out to be her plastic soda cup. So I got out and picked up her trash, walked around the car to close the rear door, and got back in.When I was leaning down to put her cup into the waterproof trash bag I strap to the front seat, she came up and said something to the effect of ""Do not mess with me"" and I noticed a two-inch electric spark about 8 inches from my nose.OK, so it was some sort of Stun Gun and not a Tazer but it sounds better.Oddly, I wasn't all that worried about it.

I drove to a quiet spot and spend quite a while emailing Uber and downloading all the audio from my cashcam. I'm upgrading to one that will record video in both front and back seat but I've only got audio at the moment. Blew the Quest cash, of course.So the moral of this story? I'm not picking up any Pools until Uber gets rid of ExpressPool.

This displays a photo of your driver along with the vehicle's make, model, and license plate number.As the car approaches, check the make and model, and then match the license plate.¬† Once you are in the vehicle, you can match the driver with his or her picture in the app.In most juristdictions, Uber and Lyft both require the driver to display the Uber or Lyft sticker on their front windshield.¬† You may want to check that too.Car info matches, but what about the driver?¬† Uber's ""Real-Time ID"" Feature:In order to prevent fraud where different people may be sharing and driving the same car (and hence Uber account), Uber has been employing a feature called ""Real-Time ID Check.""¬† This is a mechanism built into the Uber Driver app where drivers need to validate their identify by taking selfies of themselves. Then the facial-recognition feature will identify the driver and determine if he is who he say he is. They can be prompted at a beginning of a shift or asked during a shift. (For more informatino, click here:https://eng.uber.com/real-time-id-check/)Uber Beacon- ""Uber Beacon"" is the light that shines on driver's windshield.¬† As the assigned passenger, you can specify within your app the color of the light using this feature.¬† Limited to drivers who support them.¬† More information here:What are Uber Beacons?

How do I know if the Uber driver is who he says he is?,RedANT,9840,HowdoIknowif,"Please, no.¬† Quickly verifying the drivers license plate number and the picture on the Uber app is more than enough.The average rider looks at the front license plate, then they walk around to look at the back license plate, then back around to look at the front again.¬† Guess what... NOTHING CHANGED except that you're wasting the drivers time and pushing him/her to frustration and ride cancellation.¬† If you're lucky and they do put up with your ridiculous antics, hopefully you won't have pissed them off enough for them to destroy your rider rating.If you're that paranoid, please just ride the bus."

"As a Driver, will you buy Uber or Lyft stock when it becomes available?",Wes,"AsaDriver,wi",0,"It appears both Lyft (which has already initiated the paperwork to go Public) and now Uber is rushing to follow, will go public in 2019. ¬†This means stock will be available to anyone that can afford to invest.Which begs the question - will you, as a driver that truly understands how Uber/Lyft operate, be willing (assuming you're financially capable) to invest in Uber or Lyft stock? ¬†Do you feel it's a good long term investment, and if so, why?As a driver myself, I certainly appreciate that anyone driving Uber/Lyft full time as a primary source of income will most likely not have the financial wherewithal to invest in the company, so let's say hypothetically, if you could do so, would you, and if so, why do you feel it will be a good investment?"

The problem with Uber or Lyft that they have nothing except the app and a bunch of greedy people. Drivers who drive with Uber don't like how they are treated and because Uber and Lyft robber them. They charge riders up to 160% more money than they pay to the drivers! People drive with Uber only in a difficult situation when they need a cash. Nobody from them intend to drive with Uber if they will get another source of income. Because this is a hard not profitable job. All money what they get this is really a payment for depreciation of their cars. Other thing that this app what Uber and Lyft have created is a really simple app. On Kickstarter have already started a new peer to peer ¬†Free Global Transport Sharing App witch will eliminate a middle man and kill Uber and Lyft instantly.

Uber already has the market saturated so growth will be hard fought for them. Lyft's growth kinda depends on stealing market share from Uber, which will be very expensive.Both of these companies are spending money like drunken sailors and that is not going to stop anytime soon. It is a brutal battle out there and more competitors are going to be moving in on them. These are not lean companies.So my advice... buy some for fun if you want once the price settles a bit but don't go crazy, don't spend more than you can afford to lose, and don't expect to fund your retirement with it..."

Cab drivers on the forum may be able to confirm if 90% of passengers tip them, maybe that use to be the case prior to rideshare, but now with rideshare around I bet it changed in a negative way.. Rideshare drivers would not fall into same category as cab drivers by any stretch in this chart. We need our own¬†category and the percentage of tipping passengers would probably be no more that 30 (and I am being generous).If passengers being accustomed these days to not tip rideshare drivers and occasionaly¬†order a cab, I bet their cheapness travels with them and even the cab drivers will now get less tips because of it.I do not think I will ever see a cultural shift with passengers enough to have rideshare drivers in a similar chart with tipping passengers in 60/70% range"

I thought it might be one of the calls that Uber transfers through a mangler so no one can learn the other's real number so I answered.A man on a terrible phone connection (which also made me think it was legitimate) said he was from the ""Uber Main Office in San Francisco"" and they wanted to give me a $400 gift certificate for passing 1,000 5-star rides and having a high star rating.

Finally, it was my password so that they could ""attach the $400 debit card to my account."" Right then another, legitimate rider beeped in and it got a bit confusing. I gave the codt to him thinking I could change if quickly. I said I was uncomfortable and he said ""I'm from the Uber Main Office in San Francisco."" about three times.I have NO EXCUSE.What looked like more Uber codes and fill-in the box answers. He wished me well and hung up.What I noticed first was that I couldn't make calls from my car. The Uber system said it didn't recognize my number and then spun me back to the same two ""Enter your phone number"" question and answer sequences over and over. I WISH Uber didn't have such a thing against real people answering their phones!When I got home, I realized I'd been screwed good. Over the next three days, I realized he'd changed my phone number, changed all my bank codes, added an ATM debit card to my account, changed the system so I couldn't change things or get rid of the new debit card.I changed my email and password first but I think he'd also done something with my password system because I couldn't get it to stabilize. it would work and then freeze up. That could just be the usual conflict between Uber and my Dashlane password system.Of course all communication with Uber is by email and none of those Greenlight places were open. The first Email said that other drivers had been seeing the same problems and suggested I change my passwordI didn't know this at the time but I was getting emails from Uber telling me that there was strange activity on my account. I don't have emails come through when I'm working to minimize confusion.I emailed, called, and screamed to get that ATM card off my system but, since I didn't have another to replace it, I couldn't. This week was a looooong wait until the payoff showed up in my bank account.So, just a word to the wiser that a grifter with a LOT of history with Uber and the gift of gab is out there. One .of the emails said the initial weird stuff came from the New York City area. I'm ashamed he got me even though I (don't think) I've lost any money. I sure lost a lot of wasted time. On the positive side, Uber had decided the weekend was a cheapie and we're only offering $105 for 65 rides so I wasn't going to work that hard anyway.Read less..."

Done picking up at grocery stores.,RobinH74,Donepickingu,0,"I am done picking up at grocery stores. I get it that people who don't have cars have to go get food but it just does not work for us drivers.I just had this couple who had bags after bags of groceries - like 30, probably because they can't make it to the store that often. I was horrified as I pulled up of two shopping carts full of stuff, including three cases of beers and liquor. Then they had the gull to tell me they have conditions and that I need to help them. She was morbidly obese and he was on a walker which I had to also fold and put into the front seat. Well, I too have back problems from an accident with a semi a few years ago, and this is not what i signed up for.When we got to their house it was a trailer house - and they once asked me to carry the groceries to their porch. then they proceeded to move very slowly obviously accentuating their disabilities and making sure i knew that they were in no condition to carry them. To an uber driver time is money, so I start helping, just thinking i need to get these people out of the car but what really ticked me off is that this is what they expect out of drivers, any drivers, i think. ¬†i wasted 20 minutes on this couple carrying stuff they should be able to carry. no i am not your chauffer and a butler.and of course they didn't tip. not at all.

"All you clever drivers, any ideas on how to make the connection/pickup process smoother or more foolproof?",fpressly,Allyouclever,0,"Uber tends to place the pin at the rear entrance of most addresses. Savvy riders place the pin advantageously. Autofill by GPS pins the nearest roadway (not necessarily an entrance or exit). Personally I think the pin should be assigned to a person and not a place.

Whether the victim of a cancellation after driving 20 minutes to the pickup point, or the pickup is a two miles to the store ride. So the compensation should be two part. Drivers original location to pickup point and then pickup point to destination. If the driver reaches the pickup point, they are guaranteed compensation for that leg, no matter the outcome of the ride. Whether Uber wants to eat that addition to the drivers income or pass it on to the consumer, is up to them. If Uber assigns a ride that makes someone drive twenty minnutes to complete the task on Uber's behalf, then it is only right that they cover that cost of getting there.I think Uber should reduce it's take from the drivers money to a strict 15% of gross and look for alternative revenue streams to make up the difference. They are already making billions in revenue. Just because they choose to squander it or waste it on a support system that is complete qrap. That doesn't makemywallet any fatter. For a company making so much money and it's workers practically impoverished, Uber/Lyft need to wake up. They think driverless cars are going to be there savior, so they don't care how many drivers they cut loose or piss off. All those people they piss off are future foes. I am told driverless vehicles are highly susceptible to sabotage. All one has to do is block it's ability to ""see"" and for fear of hurting someone, it has to shut itself down.¬† It doesn't have to be damaging or permanent. A tacky foam or sticky paper label over the ""eye"". That will just disable the driverless car for now, for a minute. Won't hurt it, just confuse it. Make it it's own worst enemy.

"As an Uber/Lyft driver, how has driving affected your family/relationship life?",bob,7705,7680,I have always thought that taxis and rideshares should charge a extra per person fee. You are right that the wear and tear on the car with 400 extra pounds is real. Some taxis (in some cities) do have extra person charges like $1 per person after the first rider but they are usually very small fees.
Uber Drivers: How Far Will You Drive To Pick-Up A Fare Not Knowing Their Destination?,Goodideasll,UberDrivers:,0,"Uber Drivers: How¬†Far Will You Drive To Pick-Up A Fare Without Knowing Their Destination? ¬†Okay, here‚Äôs what happened today to me - I signed on to my Driver Uber App and a Premium Destination popped up. I accepted the pick-up and app informed me that the customer was 27 minutes and 13 miles away. I drove there , it took about 22 minutes. I picked up client at her house , pressed my App for the drop-off Destination , and saw that drop-off was 1 mile away. I chatted with the lady, dropped her off and headed back to my hometown of Plattsburgh, NY. Total time of trip, back and forth, 45 to 50 minutes and 29 miles , and I earned $8 dollars. ¬†So, after thinking about it, I have decided to ‚Äòdecline‚Äô all trips that are more than 10 miles away from me and do not say that it is gonna be a ‚Äòlong trip‚Äô ( one of those trips that say it‚Äôs a long way, I forget the exact wording).

Kstark77 no one is asking for ""the community to subsidize workers"". In the taxi industry it's well known you tip the driver. I get technically Uber isnt a taxi but same concept.

I know many drivers that go out of their way for riders or provide amenties in their vehicle for riders. Not to mention the crap we put up with from certain riders. A¬†$2/$3 tip is not ""sticking it"" to the rider. Just seems like you are too cheap to give a small tip for a job well done.

Should I give low ratings to Uber drivers who solicit tips?,Bigfrank,13884,ShouldIgivel,If stupid Uber didn't tell people they didn't have to tip then we wouldn't have to discuss this but it's obvious that tips are needed in order for drivers to survive since the turnover rate is so high and the fares are too low . it is very distasteful for a driver to beg for a tip which is the reason why I avoid rideshare apps like the plague.

That‚Äôs about it. Expecting someone to have a bubbly demeanor and a perfect car after a 10-12 hour shift is unrealistic and unreasonable.I still believe they should replace/supplement this 5 star business with a simple one question survey. I WOULD/WOULD NOT ride with this driver again. The computer can do the rest in keeping track and separating rider and driver. Keeping the two (driver/rider) separated might be the best thing for everyone. Some people just don't get along for whatever reason. If a driver gets enough WOULD NOTs, through lack of business they will eventually go broke and die off from attrition. Let the five star system be informational and the WOULD/WOULD NOT survey kill off the bad eggs.You have too many riders trying to scam free rides, taking out their daily angst on a driver, or they themselves are intoxicated or high and looking for a beef wherever they can find it. Uber and Lyft put far more weight on this ratings business than the riders probably realize. There are people who would NEVER give someone a five out of five about anything, because they believe nothing is perfect and it doesn‚Äôt take too many four stars to put a driver in range of danger of being removed from the platform.

A water and a pack of crackers/nuts will eat up half your profit for a less than 5 mile ride.This rating system is best described as a¬†non-zero-sum game.Cooperation is usually analysed in game theory by means of a theory called the ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" (Axelrod, 1984). The two players in the game can choose between two moves, either ""cooperate"" or ""defect"". The idea is that each player gains when both cooperate, but if only one of them cooperates, the other one, who defects, will gain more. If both defect, both lose (or gain very little) but not as much as the ""cheated"" cooperator whose cooperation is not returned. If rider and driver collaborate and give each other 5 stars, everyone is happy. If the rider ""defects"" and gives the driver a 1 star rating to get back at them or to try and scam a free ride they are cheating the driver and the purpose of the system. If the driver in turn gives the rider a 1 star rating to get back at behavioral issues, they are also cheating the system of clientele. If both rate each other 1 star. Nobody wins.

We know that sometimes things come up that prevent you from accepting every trip request, or you may want to take a break. Butnotaccepting trip requests causes delays and degrades the reliability of the system. If you don‚Äôt want to accept trips, just log off.If you consistently decline trip requests, we will assume you do not want to accept more trips and you may be logged out of the app. [3]""So, It seems as though you are correct. ¬†it will not lead to deactivation, but it does no good for the system... however... again... seeing how we are being treated and often cheated...

Cancellations create a poor rider experience and negatively affect other drivers. We understand that there may be times when something comes up and you have to cancel an accepted trip. But minimizing cancellations is critical for the reliability of the system.How is my cancellation rate calculated?Your cancellation rate is based on the number of trips canceled out of the total number of trips you accept. (For example, if you‚Äôve accepted 100 trips and 4 of them are canceled, your cancellation rate would be 4%.) High-quality drivers typically have a cancellation rate lower than 5%.What leads to you losing access to your account?Each city has a maximum cancellation rate, based on the average cancellation rate of drivers in that area. We will alert you multiple times if your cancellation rate is much higher or if you are consistently canceling more often than other drivers in your city, after which you may be logged out of the app.If your cancellation rate continues to exceed the maximum limit, you may lose access to your account.""( ref:https://www.uber.com/legal/community-guidelines/us-en/?state=oQun93rT7qNWcaN1NlRbGLJFLqwPTnxL5J-vAdKZNGg%3D&_csid=GLVlayzVKCeH_8hQd0dYTA#_)We were not talking about cancellation rates, kind of a non-sequitur‚Ä¶ but you can get deactivated for it.I stand corrected. ¬†Thank you.Also, we do not get Uber-Pro here, but apparently they are not saying ""Acceptance rate"" will affect it.I am curious about something.

Most od the time i find these pook rides to be short jerkers who can't afford the extra dollar. But cost me 1.I refuse to cancel and make them get a cancel fee.

Uber to require a 6-hour break for every 12 hours of driving in the U.S.,TonyAlmeida,Ubertorequir,0,"This is good, right?¬† Combatting sleepy and overworked drivers.""Uber has added a feature that will force a six-hour offline break whenever a driver on its platform reaches 12 hours of driving time. The feature is similar to one that Uber has in place in a few markets already around the U.S., which differs depending on local regulations, but this will apply across the U.S., and fully block use of the driver app for accepting trips during the six-hour period when it becomes active.""""Uber‚Äôs decision to roll this out was made as a response to the problem of drowsy driving and driver fatigue, both of which are issues that continue to affect people on the road, even if driving while using mobile devices and intoxicated driving get more press and scrutiny.""and it looks like they put some thoughts into this:""The Uber feature implementation will trigger when a driver has driven 12 hours without taking a continual, six-hour break at any point between. Drivers will have full visibility into how much driving they‚Äôve done according to Uber, which measures based on a number of factors, and will count things like when you‚Äôre stopped at a stoplight (your brain is still engaged in the driving activity, even if you‚Äôre temporarily stopped), but won‚Äôt count time spent waiting in an airport parking lot to be called for a pickup, for instance, since many drivers use these as napping and rest opportunities."""

You cannot pick up anywhere, however.Uber drivers can only operate and pick up passengers in areas for which they have been assigned and approved.¬† This has to do with how each local areas have different laws and regulations. You are applying to drive in a certain territory, and you are approved for that specific territory.To clarify, it is important to point out that you can pick up in your own area only, butyou can drop off outside of your territoryin any location.¬† This means that you can leave your territory with a passenger but you cannot pick up on the way home.Uber can make exceptions to this rule and approve you to drive in multiple states if given a proper justification.¬† They also approve temporary relocations, where, say, you decide to move to another state for the summer, they can grant you to operate in that area for a few months.Lyft used to have a much relaxed policy, where you could drive in multiple cities and states, and they did not have the concept of having any territories.¬† However, as the local laws and regulations tightened, they have implemented these restrictions.UPDATE: It is important to also remember that depending on your local area, Uber often extends your coverage area (where you can pickup and receive requests from) to the surrounding territories/states.¬† For example, if you are approved to drive in New Jersey, you will receive requests in states like PA, NY, DE, CT, and Western MA.¬† (not NYC, due to TLC requirements.))ippei1202Uber Driver, CEO of TaxiFareFinder and Unleashed, LLCLast updated Jun 28, 2018"

How is it on pool Uber makes more than Driver? Just had a trip 2 pools my t ...,momof4,8215,Howisitonpoo,I originally posted this because of 2 trips that Uber made more than I did. Never had that happen. I was driving Saturday night and declined a few pool trips. As I was driving driving a passenger a request came up. Since i had a passenger didnt want to take my eyes off the road to see the request and with new app the print is smaller so I ended up accepting a pool. Of course it was a ride into Center City which is about 25 min 15.55 miles. Rider pd. $17.15¬† I got 18.46 Uber took -1.68 other .37. There was no surge in pick up or drop off and no tip. A fare like this pool is usually 12.00 for pool to this area. Then I took another pool trip 26 min. 10.5 miles plus a cancellation fee for 2nd rider I received 17.58. This would normally be a 8.00 to 10.00 ride for pool. On this trip rider payment 13.53 riders paid 13.43. There was an adjustment on Uber -7.60 Uber received -4.15. WTH? I am totally confused. If I figure out how to upload a screenshot I will post. ANY THOUGHTS? Afraid Uber will take back money at later date once they figure out their screw up because this cant be right.
How is it on pool Uber makes more than Driver? Just had a trip 2 pools my t ...,amcbeth,7945,Howisitonpoo,"The reason this happens in Philadelphia, is all riders are charged a $2 booking charge plus other fees. Lets say you pick up three riders at three different stops (a pool). Those riders all get out within 15 minutes.Uber will add three booking fees ($6) and any other fees they might charge the riders. All fees are added up and subtracted from what the riders paid. Now a 15 minute trip¬†with only one rider doesn't pay much.A 15 minute trip with three riders you have to contend with at least $6 being subtracted from the rider payments. Yes Uber will definitely make more than you.If you try and figure the fees that Uber charges, you'll go nuts.In another post I took two months of payouts and used a spreadsheet to determine whether I should drive in South Jersey or Philadelphia. It wasn't close. Uber takes at minimum of 49% in South Jersey.In Philadephia, because I take a lot of pool rides, and Uber subsidizes most of them, I find that the percentage of what I get from the rider payments is much greater than in South Jersey."

This complicated rig enabled the cab driver to receive calls directly from customers, thereby giving him a way to increase his income.Dispatched calls changed in the 2000s with the advent of Gandalf terminals in taxis. Now, instead of a squawking voice giving you a constant low-grade headache throughout each shift, a screen listed available fares and it was just a matter of hitting the right buttons quicker than the other drivers to get the address of your next fare. Cell-phones evolved as well, so your regulars could summon you by voice or text with minimal effort.A few years ago, apps like Taxi Magic began to appear. They worked with cab companies to allow customers easier access to cabs. Taxi Magic gathered together the phone numbers of all local cab companies in one spot so they were easier to find. Unfortunately they did nothing to improve the problems of traditional taxi dispatching. Riders were still at the mercy of telephone operators who would stop answering the lines at peak times and drivers who had no compelling reason to pick up calls if there was enough business available on the street. The best either company dispatchers or Taxi Magic could ever do was let drivers know what fares were available, then hope, or sometimes plead that the driver would take them. The reason no company could compel a driver to pick up a passenger is that cabbies no longer work for companies. They all drove for themselves.Back in 1993, when I started driving, there were a few old-timers who¬†were still working on commission. This meant that the company would take a percentage of their shift earnings, offer them benefits like health care, and treat them as part of their company. If they had a bad night the company would make less, which would cushion the blow. Newbies like me didn‚Äôt have this option. We had to pay to lease and gas up the company‚Äôs vehicles whether we made a dime during our shifts or not. It was a fundamental shift. Taxi companies were now basically rent-a-car agencies.There were about 7,000 licensed taxis in Chicago in 2014. Those licenses‚Äîcalled medallions‚Äîtraded for around $300,000 each. In 2018 the prices have plunged as low as $50,000. Many medallion owners pay companies like Yellow Cab to manage the upkeep of their vehicles, make sure they pass yearly city inspections, and find drivers to lease the vehicles to. The city is heavily involved in regulating the industry, from setting meter rates to licensing drivers, though it remains a private business rather than a public utility, at least where taxes are concerned. The gray area between public and private makes the taxi business different than most others. The cab driver is providing a public service yet he‚Äôs not an employee of either the city or any company. He‚Äôs bound by many restrictive regulations yet rarely benefits from any protections a union or corporation can provide.Cab drivers hit the street at the beginning of every shift already in the red because we either owe the company that day‚Äôs lease or, if we‚Äôre owner-operators, we‚Äôre paying off the mortgage on the medallion, the car payment, or both. We look for every way to get access to more fares. So when Uber came to town in 2012 it seemed like a great chance to make a little more money. I was one of the first cab drivers they recruited in Chicago.Uber is not a traditional taxi or limousine company. They don‚Äôt have a garage and they don‚Äôt own vehicles. They‚Äôre a tech company that developed a dispatching app. They contract limo, taxi and private-vehicle drivers and handle payment, routing and other services through iPhones they distribute¬†to participants. In Chicago they use current taxi rates and add twenty percent to cover their fees as well as tips for drivers. They charge flat fees for limo rides, which are generally a little more affordable than established limo companies. But with both taxis and limos they piggyback on existing pay structures and regulations to offer drivers an alternate way to pick up customers. They don‚Äôt have to worry about insurance or any of the other bureaucratic headaches that old companies have to deal with. All they concern themselves with is their iPhone app which connects drivers and riders.The app is a two-way GPS which lets both driver and rider track each other‚Äôs location and make contact if plans change. Cab companies currently have nothing approaching this kind of one-to-one connectivity. There is also a rating function which allows both sides to rate the ride. It‚Äôs like Yelp except if the restaurant could rate its customers as well. It gives everyone concerned at least a bit of a clue what they‚Äôre in for. One of the hardest things about driving a cab is guessing how a person getting into the car with you will behave themselves. This system takes a bit of that guesswork out of the equation. You can see their history with the click of a button. I only used Uber for a few months before quitting the business in the summer of 2012 but came away impressed.In the last couple years there has been a lot of litigation about how ride-share will fit into the city‚Äôs public-transportation ecosystem. Services like Uber, which use private cars rather than licensed taxis and limos, add another wrinkle to the puzzle. This is an age when full-time single-source employment seems to becoming but a fond memory. People are scrambling to cobble a living together any way they can. It‚Äôs a world of Airbnb and Etsy rather than Hilton and Sears, so it‚Äôs no surprise that people would try to earn some side cash using cars they already own. I‚Äôm not sure how it will all shake out but I‚Äôm convinced the cab companies are fighting a losing battle.The reason rideshare have overtaken the public vehicle¬†business is that the taxi companies¬†have failed to serve either their customers or their drivers well. By no longer offering commissions or benefits to drivers they have created an adversarial relationship where each side tries to get over on the other rather than working together. By failing to recognize advances in technology, they have mired themselves in an antiquated dispatching system that no one involved has much confidence in. In my last couple years behind the wheel, most of my business came from either street hails or by direct text from repeat customers and their friends. No one these days wants to sit on the phone waiting for an operator to pick up on the other end.Don‚Äôt take this to mean that ride-share is a cure-all. Uber has made blunders like peak-pricing, which put me in mind of price-gouging gas stations during the seventies fuel crisis. They‚Äôll also undoubtedly need to require private-car drivers to carry commercial insurance. Almost half the cost of my cab lease was to cover insurance of various kinds. Otherwise drivers will spend more time in court than on the road. These new businesses will have their growing pains, but the city would be wise not to regulate them to death. If Chicago were to shut Uber et al down, ride-share would simply go underground. The industry has to acknowledge the way their customers live now. Whatever form of dispatch wins out, it would behoove the middlemen who run transportation companies to value the people who make their success possible. Treat the drivers, who make Uber, taxi, and every other form of public conveyance possible, like valued customers rather than chattel is key. There will always be a place for public vehicles in a city like Chicago. If Yellow Cab and its ilk wants to be part of that market, it would do well to realize that it‚Äôs 2018 rather than 1974.Read less..."

That's just like drivers used to get 75% of the fair after Uber took there booking fee. Now with upfront pricing Uber can charge the customer whatever they want to charge the customer and if the customer accepts so be it. The driver gets paid their percentage of the distance and time driven. If Uber charge of the customer for a longer route and a driver takes a shortcut guess what the driver only gets paid for the distance and time driven their percentage. Uber pockets all the rest. They grossly overcharged passengers to the point that passengers are starting to take Lyft instead of uber. Now don't think that Lyft is not doing this as well they're just not doing it as bad as Uber is doing it. But at the same time drivers don't like working for Lyft because Lyft does not charge a long pickup fee and they're always sending drivers 25 to 35 minutes away for a ride. And if the driver gets there and that ride happened to be a $3 ride that driver loses money. So drivers when it comes to Lyft are not accepting rides over the 10-minute threshold Uber has in place as a long pickup fee. I need some drivers logo 14 minutes but they won't go 15 minutes away. Drivers also don't like working for Lyft because we can't say we want to drive XL only and only get XL request. I mean if you have a larger vehicle and that's all you want to do then I think you should be allowed to only do that. But the way the system is set up you got to keep refusing the regular rides if you don't want them. And that's not right fortunately Uber will allow people to do excel only so in the evening time and on weekends and during events when it's really profitable it's going to be hard to get a Lyft request because drivers have liftoff because they're working for Uber doing XL only. But there are several things that actually need to be done with both companies. White one a livable wage for drivers during the winter time drivers have to drive hundreds of miles away and sleep in their car and take showers at Planet Fitness just to make a living because their Market is a tourist market for the summer and nobody comes here during the winter. And those themed markets that drivers are going to pet people that are actually coming to our market and sleeping in their cars and taking showers at Planet Fitness to make money during the summer because their town is a college town and the kids are gone for the summer. So yes the number one thing is a livable wage across the board I mean there has to be a standard sitting place that no matter what state you were in this is what you're going to get. That's like the drivers over in California they got those rate so low that I would not personally drive her neither company I mean the fuel is $4 a gallon how can you survive only making $0.60 a mile as a driver. If drivers were compensated fairly we would actually be able to pay federal income tax. But as it stands right now the rates are so low that everything is written off due to our mileage. all drivers are doing is trading the equity of their vehicle for money right now. when that vehicle breaks down if that driver was not smart enough to save their money that driver is out of work with no way to fix their vehicle. And when you got to think about feeding little Sammy and Josephine and your wife sitting at home or maybe there's a couple more kids in there how the hell are you going to save money for a rainy day to fix your car. You're just SOL and out of work looking for a job hoping to come up with the money to fix your car so you can start back doing this part-time and keep that job because that job saved you. And if you get a driver that has a brand new vehicle just know this they're not going to be working too long because 70,000 miles on a vehicle per year means that they will still be paying for that vehicle after it's dead. The best thing a driver can do is buy used vehicle that they're able to pay cash for and then go out and make their money. And if they get a chance go ahead and purchase a second vehicle to have sitting for backup just in case that vehicle breaks down. Yes I know I got off topic a little bit but that's the life of a driver. And most of us drivers we don't put anything past Uber. They will steal our tips they will charge the customer a higher upfront price just because they tipped their driver. And yes we have seen that happen a driver made this going from point A to point B and got a $10 tip the driver got that same customer going back 2.8 Uber charge that customer the same thing that they charge the first time including what the passenger paid as a tip without their passenger actually tipping the second time. It is actually best for you to tip your drivers in cash because Uber has their algorithm setup to where they see that a customer tipped which means and never mind that the customer is willing to pay more so therefore they charge them more. I had a woman one time that I watched give me a $20 tip and I only got $10. I had another guy then I watched give me a $5 tip and I did not even get a tip Uber will steal from their drivers and they will steal from the passengers. there is no shame in their game. And they are protected up front pricing and all these different amendments to the policy that they make drivers agree to just to go back online. If a customer makes a false complaint against a driver that driver gets deactivated with no way to provide for their family for at least Forty-Eight Hours the first time. And yes that has happened to me but you know what the next time it happens I'm going to take a hair sample test and go to the courthouse to press charges against the person who made the complaint sure I can sue that person for all my lost wages and defamation of character. Because I don't drink and I don't use drugs but I had a customer say I was impaired just to get a free ride because I would not allow them to bring an open container into my car and then changed the trip to an XL ride because they had five people.Read less..."

I spend more time to reach them and drive more miles then the actual ride. No long pick up fee for XL in my market in Uber. At this point in time Uber and Lyft need to clean up a few issues. Safety, transparency, ratings, honesty, and increase the rates. Fix all the BS and make the companies better and safer. Not holding my breath. Yes you are correct Uber does know everything about our driving habits:) Still on the fence about them hiking prices when your phone is about to die:) although it wouldnt be unheard of.

Are you familiar with the issue of how much Uber/Lyft take from the drivers pay?Are you sympathetic to the drivers or are you just happy for cheap rides?,fpressly,Areyoufamili,0,"They claimed to take 20% of gross at one point (Uber and Lyft). Then it went to 25%. However if you carefully read the trip charges of your trips you see that Uber/Lyft take certain monies before the 75-25 split. This is different fees and charges the riders pay, that the driver never sees. There have been many times where I have looked at the trip charges and the total the rider pays. Uber/Lyft sometimes end up with 50% of the money the rider pays. When you call Uber on it they don't have any real clear answer either (except love it or leave it).Do you think this is fair? Especially as costly as it is to maintain a vehicle to the standards they expect. With rare exceptions most Uber/Lyft drivers make $3-$4 an hour (after all expenses). Knowing this, would it encourage you to tip more. What do you expect from a driver to give him a 5 star rating and at least a 20% tip on fares $10 or less and 15% on more than ten dollar rides?

What are some tips and tricks to earning more from ride share.,fpressly,Whataresomet,0,"There are so many factors it is hard to quantify. First you have to be in a market where Uber is well established. Then you have to not have too much competition in other carriers like Lyft or too many Uber drivers. Then your vehicle and the costs associated with it will determine really how much you make. Having an older, nice car, like a Nissan Maxima or Toyota that you have no payments on and are real road warriors is your best bet. Then you have to watch your market for a couple of months to see where the surge patterns are (every market has cycles and ‚Äúhotspots‚Äù). Learning to work surges is your best money. Buy AAA or any roadside assistance insurance (sometimes available with purchase of new tires). It will help in a pinch, when there is no one else to help.Then you have to be willing to commit 8‚Äì10 hours a day until you fine tune the demand. Deciding time of day you will work is next (for me 7‚Äì11am and 3-darkpm). Not driving around aimlessly while you wait for rides will save fuel. I work out of the half dozen Starbucks in my city. Good wifi, coffee, people to talk to, good place to read a book. Hanging out at airports or trying to make airport runs your core business is NOT good. Just because someone is getting off of a plane doesn‚Äôt mean they are going somewhere that is good for you. Developing a rolodex of regulars will make for steady income. My best advice is to get the proper insurance (get a ride share rider from your insurance company). You can work a whole year and it will be wiped out with one accident that you are not properly insured. Thank you for your upvote."
What are some tips and tricks to earning more from ride share.,jutre,7600,Whataresomet,"Try catering your rides towards those that tend to tip. For instance I avoid the college bar scene, you will never get tips out of those rides. Business district/airport/transportation hubs during business hours are usually pretty good and filled with company paid riders in other words businessmen who will tip because it is on the companies dollar."

It entirely depends on how much work you get and you have to consider for all of your own expenses...like your car!With Uber, how much work you get is dependent on where you work and when you work. If you work for established taxi companies with a foothold in the market, you can expect a steady stream of dispatch...at least with some stability.So to summarize:- no, not every driver has a choice- the pay may not be better on Uber"

At that point he or she could keep driving or lease it to a broker in which a monthly check similar to a pension would be paid .

I assume its a family, bachelor party, etc... I pull up its 2 young 20 something females with 4 toddlers all under age of 4. They were tiny little children maybe 25lbs soaking wet. I start with sorry cant take you. Mom asks why? You have 4 toddlers with no car seats. Moms first response is ""i guess i have to pay cancellation fee"". I replied, I'll wave the fee but I did just drive here on my time and gas, you should know its against the law to transport children with no car seat. Mom, how am I supposed to know that? Me, are you serious you have 4 children you should know. Try getting some parenting classes and some common sense. Mom, the last driver took us. Me, last driver was an idiot. Mom, have a[email¬†protected]#k#@g good night. Me, my night will be good as I wont have 4 dead children on my conscience. Mom went off cussing and yelling.¬† Finally I said, I am not waving cancel fee and its pretty sad you dont care enough to keep your children safe @[email¬†protected]#e. I drove off and contacted Lyft. Of course got some BS response. They did say they reached out to mom. Mom should've been deactivated along with driver. Sent another email asking why there are no repercussions and this continues to be an issue. No response. They paid me 5.00 at Lyft's loss not moms. ¬†Never received answer if they reached out to driver. That was my 1st and last ride Friday night. I am beyond annoyed, frustrated, angry, and disgusted by these parents who just dint give a damn and by drivers who just dont give a damn (fare is more important). Yes it sucks to pull up and waste time and money but is it really worth it???? No, it shouldnt be our responsibility to care for other peoples children. However it is our responsibility to uphold the laws regarding child safety seats.Uber and Lyft need to make this a priority. Any driver caught driving children with no seats should be deactivated. Every rider requesting ride with children and no seat should be deactivated also. No excuse. Rider should be charged with 25.00 fee if driver shows up & their is a child no seat. Maybe that would prevent these irresponsible parents from putting their kids in danger. It should prevent drivers from taking these kids with no seat also.When you put your kid in a car with a stranger you do not know if they are high, drunk, tired, or just plain careless. Even if driver is very safe what about the other idiots on the road? Dont think it will not happen to your child. I am sure every parent with a permanently injured or dead child ¬†thought the way you did. Your job is to protect your children at least until the age of 18. Do your job KEEP YOUR CHILD SAFE.Can someone please explain wth is wrong with these parents? Does driver realize when they get in accident U/L going to say ""its in rules not to drive kids with no car seat, therefore we are not responsible"". Do drivers realize there is something called vehicular mansalaughter (3 to 15 yrs in prison)? Endangering the welfare of a child? Lawsuits? Just knowing I killed a child (my fault or another drivers fault, they were in my car with no seat) how could you live with that for the rest of your life? As many as 90% of Child deaths and injuries can be prevented by putting child in proper safety seat. It is the #1 killer of children.UBER AND LYFT DRIVERS PLEASE STOP DRIVING CHILDREN IN YOUR CAR WITHOUT A PROPER SAFETY SEAT.That $10/$20 ride is so not worth the risk. Fines, jail time, lawyer fees, etc... Is it really worth it? Not to mention living with the memories of killing a child. They child is going to fly through your car window or windshield. Or be killed by an airbag. WTH are you thinking?THINK BEFORE YOU DRIVE A CHILD.BASIC GUIDLINESPLEASE BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR CITY/STATE LAWS AS THEY MAY DIFFER FROM INFO BELOWChildren ages 6 to 9 yrs old need to be in booster seat unless they are over 4'9"" and over 50 lbs.

Perfect example of this is when she reached out to Lyft they gave her a cancel fee but didnt make mom pay it. Lyft paid it. How is that helping the situation. Like she stated Lyft dont suffer consequences either way. Driver has to waste their time driving to pick up and declining ride or driver picks up Lyft collects their fee from ride. If driver decides to take the ride (which isnt the best decision) and gets in accident its their ass in trouble. Lyft wont back driver and insurance wont cover. Where does Lyft lose? Thats why they bury a short statement in their rules. Their out in case of accident. Do you really think either company cares about the driver or their passengers?

I've asked quora readers to post any stories they may know of a child being injured or killed because a parent is too cluless, lazy, careless, irresponsible, or all of the above. Although I hate hearing about tragic stories especislly regarding children I feel the need to educate and raise awareness about this issue. Its not just rideshare that makes this an issue its the lack of knowledge, education, or the stupidity, carelessness, or the attitude that ""it wont happen to my kid"" that injures or kills these infants, toddlers, children under 10.I am asking the drivers out there to make a difference, to save a life, and raise awareness. I am asking parents to stop requesting rides if there is not an appropriate safety seat provided by you or a driver. Please take a few minutes to post a story, share a story, text, FB, Twitter, etc ¬†to raise awareness. You just may a save a life. Looking to do a good deed or pay it forward its easy you ¬†save a life, save a fellow driver from heartache, financial ruin, jail time etc. Please raise awareness 1 post, share, tweet, whatever you choose to use asking drivers to cancel these rides and rides not to request them. If you really are bored ir in between rides feel free to visit quora and read my answer. Feel free to add to my comment here or on quora. The more people that share, like, upvote, post, the more people we can reach in hopes of saving 1, 2, hundreds, maybe thousands of children who have clueless, irresponsible, parents. Would greatly appreciate if we could do something about helping or saving these kids. Everyday now I am getting adults with kids and no seat. First one at an airport the other night 14 month old mom and dad had the correct appropriate child safety seat. Had a 7 yr old was on taller side seatbelt wouldnt of been 100% perfect but thankfully I have booster. Approximately an hour 20 min long ride $97.00 plus 20.00 tip although declined was offered food & drink ftom BK.) Had they not had seat i would be looking at 3.75 had i not had my 14.00 booster seat same outcome 3.75. I also scored a return ride towards my destination this almost never happens when I am in this area with destination filter. ¬†$53.77 fare, my tolls paid on return trip, 12.00 tip. The ride with the kids was not pleasant for first 25 min as the baby screamed her adorable head off. Once we got on TP, lowered heat, pulled over to a Burger King to change disper and put some country music on (not my favorite but apparently hers) she went sound sleep. My point being my trip was easier, relaxing after 25 min because i had no worries of getting a ticket for no seat and no worries that the baby or 7yr old was flying through my windshield or out my side windows. Had responsible parents. Was treated well, trip nice, parents grateful for booster, and with good karma for being patient, pulling over for diaper change, assuring mom who was anxious over baby crying that I wasnt annoyed over it so she should relax. I got a good tip and a decent rider on a return trip with tolls pd and another decent tip. So with that being said wouldn't it be nice if we didnt have to decline these no car seat trips because they were not being requested. Answer I would be happier and so us my my bank account. Not that they would do it but Uber and Lyft should make a policy that the 1st time you request a car and have no seat driver will cancel ride with a 5.00 fee being charged to rider and driver reports it. Any ride requested after that will continue to incur fees going up 10.00 each time. I will be willing to bet this stops the problem altogether. Since this will not be an option unfortunately. Lets just take a stand ourselves and stop it. As always thanks for reading my lengthy posts. Thanks to those who upvote.Read less..."

You state that ¬†""sometimes you have to do what you have to do"". ¬†Can I ask what you had to do that was so important that you risked your childs life to get in a cab with no safety seat? Why not a bus or train or bring the seat? How old was your child? Just curious trying to understand the logic with the riders and drivers who take children with no seats."

I just dont comprehend putting a child in danger. If you have children do you not have car seats? I will not put my children at risk nor will I put someone elses child at risk. Uber, Lyft, dont drug test nor do they do the best background checks. How do you know the person that is driving you you isnt drunk, high, tired? Lets assume your driver isnt drunk, high, tired, they never caused an accident what about the people on the road around them? I sat here trying to think of what possible situation could anyone have that would warrant not bringing a car seat. I really cant think of any. ¬†Is there anything in this world that you need to do that is more important than your child's safety? How do you go on with your life if your child dies or is injured? I was going to say how unfair you are putting the driver in that postion but not only should driver refuse but your not keeping your child safe so why would you care about driver? Sorry but just think its very wrong, careless, just awful that people dont care about their child."
Uber Eats is not a profitable business. Here's the math. ...and how Uber has the cake and eats it too. (Forbes),SmittenKitten,UberEatsisno,0,"I am glad someone is doing the math. ¬†It's too bad it isn't the drivers. I assume this applies to UberEats' competeitors like GrubHub, Postmates, and DoorDash.The problem here is that the average profit margin for a restaurant is under 30%. Fast food such as McDonalds reported profit margins about 22% in 2017. Casual dining or family style restaurants have a profit margin between 5% to 10%. Lastly, full-service restaurants such as fine-dining have average profit margins of about 6.1%. (source)Based on the average profit margins above, every restaurant that engages Uber Eats will lose money on every order they take. The more orders coming from Uber Eats, the more money a restaurant would lose.On the other side of the phone, you will have to pay a ‚Äúbooking fee‚Äù for your delivery that is also being paid directly to Uber.

RIDERS: What are some of your reasons for not tipping a driver?,momof4,RIDERS:Whata,0,"As a rider there are various reasons for taking Uber/Lyft. Here are some of the reasons riders gave me. DUI, suspended license, ¬†dont want to drink & drive, lease car dont want to put miles on, dont have a car, cheaper than parking, and dont want to risk accident in bad weather, public transportation stinks in my area, cheaper, cleaner, more convenient then a cab. ¬†They are saving you money, no risk to your car during inclement weather, no risk for you getting in accident if drinking & driving & saving you from DUI or worse. ¬†If driver is polite, respectful, car is clean, drives you safely from point A to point B, maybe offers chargers & other amentities, possibly does a small favor by stopping somewhere. Why wouldn't you give at least 1.00 or more? Obviously they are saving you more than that few dollar tip you could give. I totally understand the driver gets paid. But by now you surely have heard that drivers are not making much $ like they used to. After Uber takes their 25%, then 2.00/2.60 booking fee, and then the ""others fee"" usually .25 to .99. ¬†What the driver actually receives isnt much. Lets not forget gas, oil changes, taxes, ride share insurance, wear & tear on car (trans fluid, tires, other fluids, etc) Not that its your fault or problem but assuming you are a somewhat decent person why dont you feel the need to tip a few dollars for a service well done? I am curious why some riders tip and others dont. If you dont tip for rideshare but tip waitress, bar tender, etc... Why someone who hands you a shot & beer, or your dinner on a plate versuses a driver who takes all the risk, gets you around safely, and saves you money?"

I loaded all of 2 bags and unloaded out of car up her driveway up 4 steps all 22 bags. Ride made me 3.45 no tip, possibly lost 2 other pool riders, and i had to cancel a 15 mile ¬†XL trip as rider needed to leave immediately couldnt wait. 3 people have thrown up in my car didnt report any of them to Uber. 2 of them friends helped me clean car and it was thankfully just liquid. One put me out of commission on New Years Eve as throw up froze to the outside of my car. Not only did I lose 2 hrs on busy night but needed 1 trip for 65.00 bonus. Husband gave me 20.00. I try to be kind and understanding. I try to do the right thing.I am not asking for a pat on the back, a medal, or a 100.00 tip. I am sure there are many other drivers who do extra ¬†things for thie riders also. I made my choices not one of them forced me to do or not do any of it. If drivers should be a kind, decent human being so should riders.In the examples I posted those people should have tipped. If I had done any of that to a driver your damn right I would've tipped and tipped big. I am not an unreasonable person. It very frustrating when you go an extra step and people like i mentioned above cant be considerate enough to tip. ¬†Its funny how the more you do for someone you get no tip or not much of one. The less you do the more people tip and the bigger they tip. (Not in all instances but a lot of them) Go figure.Read less..."

In fact it went from a 4.7 to a 4.5 in eight rides and I have absolutely no idea why.

The first time it was jarring, but now that I know none of them will ever offer I'm used to it, I'm not frail, but it's still completely different from pre-uber days when taxi drivers were eager to help knowing it could mean a good tip. And to be honest, greeted with such ambivalence I am inclined not to tip, but I always do, on the app, either 15 or 20%.. I don't carry cash so it's always on the app. I also always leave 5 stars, except one extremely bad driver who shouted into a phone for the entire 30 minute trip and drove like a maniac, but even then I didn't leave a bad rating, rather no rating at all.So that leads me to my behavior. I'm the type of person who is always punctual and organized, there have been no issues with drivers having difficulty finding me, and I'm quick to load my luggage and get in the back seat with care not to slam or scuff. I always wear a mask, greet the driver with a thank you, some small talk if they want. If I'm tired from a long trip and don't want to talk I tell them they're welcome to put on a radio station of their choice. I've never asked for climate control, or opened the window at highway speed, I'm usually dressed business casual and don't smell (no cologne, not a smoker or drinker), I can't remember ever speaking on the phone during a trip. I used to say I will tip them on the app as I got out of the car (and always did) but I've read I should never say that for some reason, so I stopped. I do often tell them I plan to give five stars, and thank them for the ride, and again I don't slam the door because I hate when people do that in my car. I ride on my company's Uber account but I don't think the driver can see that or that it would make any difference. I live in a busy part of Brooklyn where the driver can always pick up another fare instantaneously. I do not eat or drink in the car, if anything I am usually quiet underway because I'm tired and I sometimes rest my eyes or just look out the window. If the driver wants to talk I always oblige, and I have listened to some crazy conspiracy theories while just nodding my head, occasionally there is a wonderful, thoughtful chat we both seem to enjoy, but never an argument..So I am mystified why I have such a low rating. Is it because they're all airport trips? Do the drivers perceive me poorly because I'm white and they are Indian/Bangladeshi/Pakistani - I wouldn't think so? A couple days ago I took a $129 surge ride home from Newark airport, tipped 15%, my rating is still 4.5. Am I supposed to start preparing dinner for these guys and reading a bedtime story or what? I've only one time sensed the driver was upset (the shouting guy who I didn't rate) otherwise every driver seemed cordial and content, and yet they are giving me poor ratings, for what I really can't imagine. Can anyone enlighten me please?The sad thing is now that I'm aware of my plummeting rating I really don't want to give 5 stars or tip anymore, but I do because everybody has to eat. In my opinion this Uber rating system is just bad business, it has no real criteria, can be purely based on looks or race or perceived entitlement and has caused me to no longer enjoy riding. I should probably just stop looking at it, but it irks me that drivers are passing up my fare for no good reason, and those who do pick me up have a bad impression of me before I even get in. I've asked my company if they'll open a Lyft account but they are sticking to only Uber.Read less..."

After making a stop for them dont even say thank you or at the end of a trip. I am sure drivers out there no the type. They are on an expense account (even their 1st class flight, high end hotel), have that self entitled attitude, basically treat you like you are the lowely hired help beneath them. Had one to JFK last week. Right before trip my daughter calls and tells me she may have cancer. So my mind is racing as is. ¬†Stopped not once but twice. No thank you from rider. Listened to him talk about some gross thing on his side and how he wanted to pick it and if he said like or cool one more time I would've choked him. ¬†Worried about my daughter. Cant pick up anyone in NY, it was rush hour (traffic never good but rush hour is a nightmare), and not only did his attitude suck but didnt tip a dime. Karma bit him in the ass. As he exited my car he ¬†dropped his laptop on the concrete:) No my daughter didnt have cancer she misunderstood doctor when she said she has some abnormal cells that needed to be watched. Just mentioned that to make a point how people get in your car treat you like dirt and they just dont care. Does it kill a rider or driver to say hi, how are you, how is your day? Of course I wouldnt blurt out my daughter may have cancer but it would be nice for everyone to treat each other with kindness and respect. Suppose your rider just found out they or their family member had cancer or some other terrible thing happened would ot kill you to be nice? Or to listen to them? Yes, i know you dont get paid to. Just the decent thing to do. I know another driver who was taking rider to airport so he could get to his dying brother. ¬†Hot the call on the way there he died. The driver said he was sorry and listened to the guy for a few minutes. Just doing a nice thing because. He received a $20.00 tip.Read less..."

What can your riders do to make your life a little easier?,fpressly,Whatcanyourr,0,"Make themselves readily findable. Help the driver to find them quickly and easily by text or calling. Treat the driver with the same dignity and respect they would like to be shown. Be personable and reasonable in your demands.

Believe me they have far more personal expenses driving this vehicle and responsibilities for your safety than either of those groups and you tip bartenders and waitstaff unhesitatingly 20‚Äì25%.

Ambassadors from Other Cities: The Global Culture of Cab Drivers,Samarov,Ambassadorsf,0,"*In 2003 the Public Chauffeur Training Institute was located at Harold Washington College on Lake Street downtown.

Not a single one of us wanted to be a cab driver for any significant length of time. At least that‚Äôs what we all confidently told one another in the first class. Our teacher, a retired driver, wanted us to tell what we knew of each other‚Äôs cultures. When we went around the room introducing ourselves, racial and ethnic prejudices were given full voice. It was mostly for laughs and to break the ice but it was quite clear that few of us knew much about other tribes and what little we did know wasn‚Äôt flattering. The Africans were likely cannibals, the Southeast Asians all smelled and I‚Äîas the lone Jew of the bunch‚Äîundoubtedly owned a bank and was just slumming it. We all laughed and reassured one another that here in America we were all after the same thing.One of the refrains of the two-week course was about how in Chicago cab drivers were ‚ÄúAmbassadors to the City.‚Äù It was our job to present our town to visitors in the best possible light. According to the handout we were made to repeat out loud in unison over and over, we were to be some combination of tour guide and civic booster to each and every passenger getting into our cab at O‚ÄôHare, Midway or Union Station. What did any of us actually know about this city aside from being from elsewhere and finding ourselves here in need of some way to get by? That would remain to be seen.Over the nine years that I drove, I rarely ran into my classmates. Most don‚Äôt stick with it very long. The two-week class hardly prepares you for the actual job. It takes months to even begin to make sense of it, let alone earn any money at it. When we would run into each other, though, there might be a slight nod, a half smile, but not much more. It‚Äôs a solitary thing, driving a cab and each of us was in it to get elsewhere as fast as we could. To talk to each other would be to acknowledge that we had stuck around longer than we had intended; it was more or less to acknowledge our failure to find any better way to make a living.At the airports, cabstands and all-night restaurants where cab drivers congregated, most typically stuck to their own kind. Pakistanis might break bread with Indians but would do so less often with Eastern Europeans or Africans, and the same would hold true for most races and ethnicities. The American melting pot had not had its way with this bunch quite yet. Every so often there were exceptions. Differently colored and clothed men could sometimes be seen strolling together up and down the rows of taxis at the O‚ÄôHare Staging Area. The African food truck parked by the cabstand at the Sheraton boasted customers from every continent. The managers and other employees at the garage‚Äîoften former drivers‚Äîhailed from every country imaginable.The Public Chauffeur Training Institute moved to Olive-Harvey College on the far South Side a few years back, but I have no doubt that at the beginning of every new course the students break the ice more or less like mine did in 2003. They‚Äôll joke about where they‚Äôre from and promise one another that they‚Äôll only drive for a year or two until something better comes along. They‚Äôll learn the city and share it with their passengers the best they can. Each will represent Chicago as a mixture of where they came from and where they‚Äôd like to go; every tick of the taxi meter taking them a little closer to their next destination, wherever that may be.Read less..."

I mean really A-hole, uneducated mother F*** peace of SH#%#T!!!! REALLY!!!I said Ok and carried on. The next day all DVMs and every store and every place on earth shut down due to COVID-19. So, I could not go to DVM or even drive or do anything. I waited till July and took the time and visited DMV and got a new DL along with a letter from state of secretary that states when my DL was issued and my record has been super clean. Those documents cost me $29 and I had to drive around with a stupid temp DL until I got my real new DL in the mail. Went back to stupid Uber Greenlight in-person again. The same person who spoke to me last time was there. He remembered me. I showed him all the new documents and the letter he requested. They uploaded all the BS to whatever special team they have. It has been almost a week and no word of any kind. My account is still deactivated. I have a feeling this is not going to resolve and it was a total waist of F*** time and money spent.I care less to drive for Uber and as matter a fact ever since I have been with Lyft for past ~4 years I used Uber occasionally.

They make weird reasoning and basically stop returning your calls.They do this in markets where they feel are too many drivers, because they feel average pay is becoming too low.In some markets, they have to report the average pay to the authorities and if it falls under a certain threshold, they have to control the # of drivers. Technically, they don't have to have a reason to fire their drivers, (as it is all independent contractors with no benefits), but it's been brutal for many.It also plays into their publicity too. If drivers in certain markets say they are only getting paid $10,000 a year, it'll be more difficult for them to find drivers in markets the drivers are scarce."

Getting the same response ‚Äòto have patience ‚Äò is maddening! Good Luck LS!
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",SF2016,Gunputtomyhe,0,"I just had an incident Monday night driving for Uber, and despite an initial quick response, they have not responded to 4 emails back to their email.Myself and two of my Uber Pool passengers had guns put to our heads and were robbed of our valuables (phones, wallets, etc). Two guys in a car sped up and passed us on the wrong side of the street, blocked us in, ran towards us with guns and put one to the back of my head as they demanded we give them our stuff. Then they drove off.I have a number of concerns with Uber's handling of this situation, how it should be¬†handled, whether they are going to help me replace my phone, etc.I see now that Oakland is still the most dangerous city in N CA and even with the gentrification that can be seen, the very real dangers still exist in various parts despite what appears to be a fresh new mix of people.They think nothing of sending drivers into the neighborhoods to provide their service. When workers work in dangerous conditions they are made aware of the the risks, they are informed of what to do in various circumstances, and basically receive training for safety. Uber says nothing of the dangers drivers should be aware of, they don't inform drivers of how to best handle possible robbery situations at gunpoint, etc. Yet they freely send us, and other unsuspecting rideshare passengers into one of the most dangerous cities in the USA and say nothing to help us keep ourselves safe should we encounter a gun put to the back our head.Suggestions? Clearly they would not ignore this if it were an ""employee""...LM"
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",SF2016,16995,Gunputtomyhe,"Thanks for the support everyone, I thought i had properly responded but I was off.

But yes fortunately it was over with no one getting shot. But seriously, why drive into Oakland and subject one's self and passengers to the risks???***In response to the previous Post on cameras, no I had not yet installed one although a previous SUV I was using did have a front camera. No help there.I didn't get the contact info of the other passengers as we all gave statements to the police there at the site. I'm assuming one of them did contact Uber.

I see that Uber zero'd out their fee but not the passenger who was dropped off before the incident.One thing that was a valuable lesson, be prepared to track your phone and know how you'd get it done if it was out of your possession (log in from someone else's phone for example). It's helpful for the police to track it immediately. I was able to (hours later) lock my phone remotely from my laptop and send the police it's last know location. It got the job done but a couple hours late.Uber's insurance company contacted me to find out if my vehicle was damaged but since it wasn't nothing more was done from them. And based on the news that came out today on Uber's crime investigation department, they appear to be on one track only, covering their own liability exposure. As a contractor, I don't think they intend to follow up with me anymore now that they know there was no physical injuries or vehicle damage. I doubt they care about replacing my $800 phone.Rule of thumb is: They use the drivers and we're just a means to an end and they try to minimize their liabilities with us.***Their response seemed reasonable at first until you look closer and see their complete lack of attention to the facts. She says she called me... Which part of ""they took my phone"" was overlooked. I've sent 4 emails after this asking what's next and no one has responded with anything. ""... launched an internal investigation""... Did you see today's article about Uber‚Äôs investigation team? They don't report crimes to the police if we tell them, that lies in our hands, their priority is to limit Uber‚Äôs legal liability first, previous team members complained of burn out, etc. They don't seem to be an any condition, or have an interest in anyone's well being, just covering their exposure.""Thank you for reporting this situation, Louie. We tried reaching you at the number associated with your Uber account. Our team has launched an internal investigation and someone will be in contact with you as soon as possible regarding this matter.If you choose to reach out to law enforcement you may have the official you are working with submit their request for information atlert.uber.comat their earliest convenience. We have a dedicated Law Enforcement Response Team that handles all information requests.If you have further details about this incident that you would like to share with us in the meantime, please feel free to respond to this message. We look forward to speaking with you soon""Looks all good until you don't hear from them again...***Thanks for the support below. No, I didn't have a dash cam in this vehicle. Police report was filed right after, I provided them with my phone's last location but hadn't followed up with them. I have sent messages to several press outlets and waiting to see if there are responses.So a variety of things have been done and I'm waiting on replies. I'm also sharing the experience with pool riders, they need to ge aware of where their other riders are taking them, which neighborhoods they end up passing through etc. They can't take it for granted that they're safe, that's one giant false sense of security they seem to have.-Just saw a couple more posts come through, I'll reply normally there...Read less..."
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",Uberserge,16983,Gunputtomyhe,Do you have a dash cam? It's always the best proof! Invest in a double view one where it records outside and inside the car simultaneously.
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",momof4,16990,Gunputtomyhe,Just looked this up to see if it made it to the media. I dont see anything. If I were you I would call your local news station. Maybe they will respond then. Also I heard if you put complaints on twitter they respond.
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",Uberserge,16991,16990,"I tweeted it, let's see. There's a panic button on my app, I told this driver how to use it on a previous post."
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",sharknado,16986,Gunputtomyhe,"Holy crap. This is my worst nightmare. You're right, Uber should be handling this somehow.Taxis in my city always have a big thick plastic shield in front of the back seat. For this reason. Not bulletproof but enough to keep physical barrier between driver and pax and prevent any grappling etc. Maybe someone needs to market these for uber drivers. Uber should give them to people driving in high risk areas."
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",momof4,16988,Gunputtomyhe,Sorry you hsd to go through this. I cant even imagine how you and your passengers felt. I cant say that I am surprised by how Uber is handling this. Obviously I dont agree with it. I am assuming you called the police? As a driver I know Uber dont care about us and we are on our own out there. If I were you I would go to the press. Unfortunately if we dont make these issues known nothing will ever be done about it. I try to stay out of those neighborhoods unfortunately nowhere is safe and its not easy to stay out of them. Have they been able to track your phones? What have the police done if anything?Were you or passengers able to get a license plate or any descriptions? Did you have a dashcam? If you didnt and decide to continue to drive please invest in one. Again sorry you had to go through this. Thankfully none of you were physically injured. What about going to your local Hub? I dont think you will get anywhere my just messaging them. Best of luck.
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",dracomalfoy,16985,Gunputtomyhe,"Wow, did you get the contact info of your pool pax? I am curious if they have contacted Uber and if so if they have had more luck? Did you contact police?"
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",Uberserge,16981,Gunputtomyhe,"Uber doesn't care, I'm very sorry about what you went through. I hope you filed a police report. You do know there's a panic button on your driver app now? E-mails won't do it. Click on your driver picture, then the help button next to the question mark, scroll down you'll see an emergency number. Call that immediately. Thank God you and your passengers are all right."
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",Bigfrank,17253,Gunputtomyhe,I would definitely seek legal counsel and thank God your safe and alive
"Gun put to my head, with Uberpool passengers - Oakland",DanHennison,17038,Gunputtomyhe,"Unreal. Have you decided if you will continue driving? I'm not sure I would after an incident like that, really not worth the pennies that Uber pays."

Better awareness of dangerous locations and training isn't too much to ask for. Uber has the crime data that they track, but they don't disclose it, not a surprise.B) Passengers: Better awareness, I don't think passengers understand the risks they take on pool rides. Uber is setting up the transaction, but they also should understand that Uber will state they're not at fault, they're just a tech company, the ""contractor"" is in charge when they on a ride. We all need to wake up to our own responsibilities in these transactions.The phone... Sure they can say it's not their problem, they can look at their ""legal"" obligation and say f*ck off, we're in the clear. ¬†But as much as they claim to be there for the ¬†drivers and passengers a humane thing might be to reach out and say hey, let us cover that loss.I understand better, we don't work for Uber, we work for ourselves, sounds simple enough, and we should know better.

Happens to me every weekend on bar pick ups. There are many more things and when I first started driving I got caught up in a few of their lies.

"Lots of Driver Scams - Watch out, passengers!",Bigfrank,5111,LotsofDriver,The scams started with uber then downstreamed to tightwad passengers then app drivers returned it back upstream.
"Lots of Driver Scams - Watch out, passengers!",ShellyGarant,11468,5111,Whats wrong with that? If that driver got the ping for a ride he or she is still the closest driver. Pants on or off it takes 5 seconds to put them on. Better that make the streets busier and waste gas. Right?
"Lots of Driver Scams - Watch out, passengers!",MickDorsey,11480,11468,Which comment are you responding to? ¬†Are you referring to how some drivers wait for a ping while sitting in their homes?That‚Äôs too funny. I‚Äôm sure many do it. Say in suburbs.
"Lots of Driver Scams - Watch out, passengers!",momof4,11518,11480,I usually sit at a gas station 2 blocks from my house waiting for rides when I start my shift. My house is 2 blocks from the gas station. Why would it matter if I sit at the gas station or sit at my house? It takes me 30 secs to go out start my car and head to pick up. If I am in my house or at the gas station its taking me same time to get there. ¬† I am not getting paid til rider is in my car and start the trip. Why should Uber or rider dictate or care where I wait? Not costing them anything. Also no rules on Uber where you can and cant sit while waiting for rides. Before a driver accepts a trip they are on their own time.
"Lots of Driver Scams - Watch out, passengers!",LG-PA,11510,11480,"I often have both apps on and am doing things around the home (live in suburbs), Of course I know that if a ping comes in I am to leave home within 2 minutes and head over"
"Lots of Driver Scams - Watch out, passengers!",Bigfrank,10444,LotsofDriver,Scamming although unethical would be almost unheard of if these deplorable app companies didn't scam ¬†their drivers by lowering rates and not adding a auto tip .

By the time you swipe 2X you couldve dialed 911.¬† It's still better to call 911 with a location. The sad part is if someone truly needs 911 and just uses Uber's app chances are they will not be able to find you just by sending your location from app. Beware police can only track your location in 10% of calls that go out. Please keep that in mind you are better off calling and give your location. I know Septa buses in Philly at one time could change their sign to ""call police"". Would be nice to have something like.

My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,kaypoli,Myhubbyisari,0,"Hello!I really wish to get some help here!!The problem is, my husband is a rideshare driver in Boston Massachusetts, and honestly since he started working as a rideshare our marriage is going down hill and honestly I can see our marriage getting to an end. I‚Äôll explain!He drives way too long hours, of course because we need the money and I do work as well, but with 2 kids we need to work hard.The thing is, I think that he cheats on me..and that makes me think that every single woman that gets in his car is an easy target and they will have a fun conversation, laughing etcI got to say that I don‚Äôt like Boston to the point to live far away, I‚Äôm in another state and he comes every month to see us. We‚Äôre making plans to change this..the kids misses him way too much.So, I really need helpFor you rideshare guys..is it like this?! Do the passenger are way to beautiful and nice? Because I think he is cheating on me and flirting with every single¬†woman that he takes back and forth.Help please.."
My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,daisygirl,17365,Myhubbyisari,"Sorry that you are feeling this way, a job should not be ruining your marriage! I am a female driver so my experience may be different than a males driver perspective but it is not very easy to have relations with your passengers in my opinion! Many trips are fairly short, you hardly get past the friendly how are you chatter before you are on to the next passenger. Many people travel in multiples making a situation of cheating even more unlikely.Does your husband drive at night often? I would think this would be a time for more temptation (drunk passengers) but again most girls will travel in groups at night.Do you have any reasons to suspect your husband? Has he been unfaithful before? Have you found any evidence in his car?Could your husband pick up another job to earn extra income? Perhaps a delivery driver where he hardly interacts with others?"

My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,outlandish,17370,Myhubbyisari,I hate to say it but if you don't trust him not to cheat then maybe rideshare driving isn't the main problem here... Might be time for some counseling.
My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,Fishman,17395,Myhubbyisari,"Highly unlikely. As the 2 lady drivers basically say below, it‚Äôs superficial conversations to keep passengers happy, the passenger wants to get somewhere in terms of location, not in terms of relationship, and anyway, I don‚Äôt want to creep out my female passengers. I can sometimes get passengers who talk quite personal stuff, but I don‚Äôt initiate and I don‚Äôt probe with questions, again because I don‚Äôt want to creep them out. We have guidelines on communicating with passengers. Flirty language is not allowed. I‚Äôd hope passengers who feel uncomfortable with a driver‚Äôs conversation reported them as those drivers give the rest of us a bad name."
My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,chocolove,17386,Myhubbyisari,"I'm curious as to why you think he is cheating. In my opinion, if someone is a cheater they will always find a situation in which they can cheat. By making him quit rideshare driving will do nothing for your relationship. Most jobs involve working with others and working with others of the opposite sex, perhaps you need to look deeper into your relationship to overcome these feelings."
My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,bettybop482,17385,Myhubbyisari,Why do you live in another state? Is rideshare driving all your husband does for work? Can't he drive wherever you are currently living? I would think the distance would be a reason for the relationship strain not the act of rideshare driving.
My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,joeyj,17381,Myhubbyisari,I live and drive in Boston. Trust me not every ride is full of flirty attractive women. I wish it was..it's not like that. I wouldn't worry so much. Plus if you're not even living there why worry so much about how many hours he's driving. He's doing his best for ya. Good luck to you.

Unlike a regular job where he needs to be at a specific location and having the hours tracked, driving gives so much freedom of hours and locations."
My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,AsStibelDude,17528,Myhubbyisari,"Well, in general, the demographics of people who take Ubers are younger generation. Not sure about beautiful but younger more affluent people take them, sure. ¬†Then it also depends on where. If your husband chooses to drive in downtown Boston like Back Bay or Financial District, he‚Äôd definitely see young female professionals. This is even more true near campuses, like in Cambridge.Not sure if drivers are all that successful in meeting females while driving for Uber but that‚Äôs hard to comment specific to your husband. Yes, the encounters are there, but I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs easier to meet someone at a bar than driving for an Uber"
My hubby is a rideshare driver and I HATE it,Xtrodinary1,17430,Myhubbyisari,"To be honest, if you think your husband is cheating he probably is or is going to for a few reasons. One, your insecurity is making you less and less attractive to him. No man wants an insecure woman and no woman wants an insecure man. That quality is unacceptable by any standard of humanity, unless for a POMP. Two, the conversations that the two of y'all are going to have, will be focused on everything else besides the two of y'all. The proper focus in a relationship is each person focusing on how to make the other person happy Not how happy is the other person making you. When your so focus on what the other person is or isn't doing you, you lose sight of what your doing to them."

Sooner or later it will bubble out of you, perhaps you can talk to a therapist who can give you some pointers on bringing this up to him? Think about waht you want to achieve.

I was in shock and got the necessary information but so dazed that when he drove away in the amazingly still running car, I had not had the presence of mind to call for the police, which I should have. In this case, the taxi company took care of everything, except me. I had a serious case of whiplash and any claim of mine I had to deal with by myself. Eventually I hired a lawyer, the insurance company insisted their insured had done nothing wrong as there was only the damage to the cab as indication of the nature of the accident, and they had been having trouble finding their insured. My lawyer suggested I pay to hire a detective to locate the driver, I reluctantly agreed and within a couple of days was informed that he had been found. He had been shot dead on Market Street in San Francisco and the insurance company quickly settled.A few months ago, now driving for Lyft, I was hit by a police car in an apparently distracted driving moment, but of course the police are NEVER at fault and they concocted a scenario to blame me for making an inappropriate turn. This took a contingent of about eight squad cars to make sure the officer was not under attack. I was actually avoiding two other police cars who were attending to police buisness, but that was beside the point to them.What is relevant is that I had get my fender fixed from the damage the police car caused. My insurance paid for the damage but not for the inconvenience or time off necessary to deal with the repair and I was out the¬† $500 deductable and the lost wages. Typically I don't work on Monday and Tuesday and thus I try to take care of as much business on those days as possible. Every time I have ever had to deal with a fender bender it has taken the body shop five days to do a bumper/fender replacement, so I usually lose a minimum of two work days in the mix. Other than the situaltion with the police, I have been successful on two occasions getting compensated for lost wages. THe insurance company has respected my claims and I submit to them a copy of the record of my earnings to demonstrate what my likely earnings would be if I had not been inconvenienced.I am not so sure how it will play out with a more current incident, where a man hit my car while I was stopped, with my foot on the brake and he tried to parallel park in a space too small. He reeked of pot smoke when we finally exchanged information and his insurance company claim is that I hit him coming around a corner, which could not have happened in the narrow alley where we were both driving. My insurance company is covering the repair, minus my $500 deductable of course, and I will be missing days of work this week, hopefully no more than two. If the company cannot finish the repairs by the end of the day on Friday then I will have to wait until Monday to get the car and I will lose an entire weeks income, plus have to try to get my insurance company to press his company to pay not only my deductable, but also the lost wages.My next question will be how I am to pay the rent on time.Read less..."

I quickly realized I was back in the same business but was now expected to wear a suit and drive a town car.I did that for two years before switching to UberX and Lyft and have noticed how little has changed for one simple reason. People don't change.People still go to work, sullenly, reluctantly and then go home, sometimes with a stop at a bar or a grovery store or to pick up kids, but they go home. Then they go out again. They do these things increasingly as the week progresses until on Thursday evening you have folks who are eager to rehearse their weekend drinking, and on Friday all the people that think that because it's Friday and everyone else is going out they are suppossed to go too. On Saturday, they are nursing a hangover, doing their laundry, buying groceries and trying to line up a date for the evening. Then they go out and go to a restaurant, and or a bar, and or a movie, etc. On Sunday, there is a contingent of mostly younger folks who refuse to let the weekend die easily and contiue to party, but they quit earlier and the city begins to die by nine or so in the evening. On Monday few people go out, on Tuesday, much the same, on Wednesday it's slightly better and on Thursday it all starts again. They do these activities until the bars close and they are forced to go home.People have been performing this pattern for a very long time. It is exactly the way it was when I was first driving a taxi in the mid seventies and today nothing is different except for the illusion that because of the wonders of the digital age, somehow Uber and Lyft make it all different. People in groups in cities change slowly or not at all.That is why driving Monday to Friday from nine to five doesn't work all that well. Thinking you want to do that is assuming that business wants to be there when you want it to be there and that is a fundamental error. You must adapt to be available for business for when you are needed.Read less..."
Is driving from 9-5 a pipedream for an Uber driver?,AsStibelDude,5856,Isdrivingfro,"Here's an advice.¬† To be a good rideshare driver, you have to be mindful of the demand of people's travel. At first, you have to do this consciously.¬† Check your local Amtrak schedules, look up local events, when and which restaurants are busy.¬† You have to do this while also gauging the *supply*, ie other drivers.The good news is that you will quickly learn and go into a routine.¬† You will just naturally know, and it becomes a part of your shift.Further advice: here are the hot times, at least wher eI am, and usually in urban areas:6:00AM to 10:00 - People going to airports or for work.12:00PM to 1:30PM - People going to lunch4:00PM to 7:00PM - People going home and to dinnesr, etc.10:00PM to 2:30PM - People going home from bars (especially weekends - infinite demand)Plus any other times when there are local eventsKeep track of your hot and popular times!Good luck!"
Is driving from 9-5 a pipedream for an Uber driver?,LCarpenter,5852,Isdrivingfro,"Like others have said, finding a lucrative time driving rideshares takes an art form. You have to continue tweaking the hours you work, look up local events, and look and plan for anything that may spike the demand in your favor.Most drivers do learn that you can make 2x 3x money during certain hours, so they focus on those. This is usually early morning (before traffic increases efficiency), Mondays/Fridays when transportation hubs are busy, and on weekends, when people are out.It really is difficult to do regular business hours."

Leaving at 4am for SFO from East Bay are uber & Lyft available?,lilly,20015,Leavingat4am,Uber is actually rolling out a new service that guarantees the ride! It is calledUber Reserve. It doesn't look like it is available in your area yet but keep an eye out as they are expanding this service!
Leaving at 4am for SFO from East Bay are uber & Lyft available?,SShakes,20012,Leavingat4am,I reserved a Lyft and heard from them the night before. Slept well knowing someone would pick me up on time. At the airport now. Thanks for the advice.

Leaving at 4am for SFO from East Bay are uber & Lyft available?,chawes,20004,Leavingat4am,Yes you can. However with uber it's just going to make the ride request for you in time for 4am. You are not reserving a driver.With Lyft they'll actually let drivers commit to the ride ahead of time. So I'd lean toward doing this with Lyft rather than Uber.

First, the drivers' complete and slavish reliance on nav systems rather than either listening to passengers or actually knowing the city. Second, the weird breakdown of the personal/professional line between passenger and driver. In my day, someone sitting up front was a breach of protocal unless there was no more room in the back; in the rideshare experience there's an illusion of familiarity which I find profoundly disconcerting. As a bicyclist, the brazen and careless way ridesharists use bike lanes for drop-offs is a constant source of frustration. But in the very near future, rideshare will be the only game in town.

Most people probably just open it to request a ride not to look at their trip history. Once ride is over they probably dont even look at it unless of course they want to complain about something:) ¬†I would think riders would want to make sure driver ended trip and correct amount was charged. Guess they dont care to check either one. If they did they woukd see tip option.
Unbelievable! My Uber rider thought we were still not able to accept tips. WTH?,Uberserge,15110,15106,Another reason for not tipping is 90% of the Riders once they ordered their ride they don't look at the Uber app and one day leave the car there usually in a rush and it's forgotten that's also another reason Uber drivers get rated maybe in 3 out of 10 tips
Unbelievable! My Uber rider thought we were still not able to accept tips. WTH?,Uberserge,15108,15106,This also has a lot to do with their pricing games Uber is playing these days such as charging the passenger surge amounts and not passing it to the driver so ride prices have gone up quite a bit over the last year or so meaning is the same ride year ago was twenty bucks now it's at 30 bucks the passengers are feeling more reluctant to tip

He got me there safely, car was clean, and he was polite. He didnt ruin my day by passing my destination by 2 blocks and it wasnt the end of the world. Can you imagine if every person who took Uber or Lyft was judged on how well they did their job by people giving them stars? Can you imagine those people being fired simply because someone was in a pissy mood or just felt like they wanted something for free so they made up some BS story? Your job would be more annoying more stressful and just an awful place to be. Ok got off the tipping part sorry. I did order about 8 Ubers for my daughter in law and 1 for my daughter on my account. I just want to mention I threatened them with bodily harm if they got less than 5 stars on my rider account. When the ride is over those 5 stars pop up and ask rider to rate driver. As soon as you rate the tipping option pops up. Not only does it pop up nice & big but in bright royal blue next to the list of trips the rider has taken is the option to tip for 1 MONTH after the ride. There is also an option to tip again. I have tried it up to 3X. All 3X driver received that tip. Sorry but didnt feel the need to put any more money out:) Driver probably thought I was crazy but didnt mind getting 3 tips. With that being said there may be 10% of riders who still think there is no need to tip. The rest either tip, feel the driver dont deserve it, dont tip anyine at all no matter what, visiting from another country, or are just cheap. Uber makes it plain as day for 1 month to be able to tip driver. Dont let riders make you think otherwise. I think my grandpop probably wasnt a frequent Uber rider. Just my opinion.

I used to get more cash tips but seens like most people are tipping in the app. I have no complaints about that but me personally I tip cash. If I order dinner & use my card ¬†I try to always make sure I have cash. In a resturant if I use my card I try to always bring cash. Why let Uncle Sam take your $ or have the waiter/delivery person lose money to taxes. Government gets enough of our hard earned $.

I am moving off the beaten path with a gripe about Hewlett Packard!!,fpressly,Iammovingoff,0,"I have owned Hewlett Packard printers for most of my adult life. Sure I have tried others, but seem to find my way back to HP. Their drivers and hardware just work. Sometimes you get lemons; but, the modern day HP with Windows 10 is fairly stable and reliable. The only gripe I have (well maybe I should say the first part of a three point gripe) is how expensive the ink cartridges are. Sure the printers are dirt cheap and they make their money on the ink. I get that part. What I don't like is the hardcore sales pitch they constantly barrage you with coupled with this ""expiration date"" nonsense. And I say nonsense because unless the cartridge has been opened and the ink evaporated the cartridge should be good forever. It is a sealed container and the ink does not leave the cartridge by osmosis. Many years ago when HP started the business with ""expiring"" cartridges it was a means to manage service contracts and keep opened cartridges fresh. The expiration date applied to open cartridges in machines, not sealed cartridges on the shelf. Now years later people have forgotten their original intent and think the expiration date on a cartridge makes it useless. Let me pose a question. All the various printer manufacturers have cartridges that operate on the same basic technology. The inks are almost identical in makeup and the cartridges, although shaped different; essentially work the same way. Why is it then that none of the other cartridges have expiration dates? Hmmm have you ever asked yourself that? Because those other companies just don't know what they are doing? Yeah okay. HP is the only smart guy. Well if you believe their propaganda and throw out those ""expired"" cartridges then I guess they are the smart guy. Much to the detriment of the consumer."
