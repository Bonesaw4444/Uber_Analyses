Bonus with Uber,,457196,0,
Bonus with Uber,mrwhts,7335650,457196,Anyone getting horrible bonus with Uber. I have not driven in bit since the bonus has been crap. Also average pickups are stupidly far.Does Uber think it will keep drivers with 10-15 an hour?
Bonus with Uber,BrainDead Driver,7335667,457196,The bonuses all ran out here as well in detroit mi . I was getting a good bonus of 100 extra per 10 rides in a different city . With out that 100 extra that city is trash short rides all college town. Heavy traffic one way streests stop and go .Expect to earn 12 an hour max in that city . It was a 40 minute ride to get there each way but worth the additional 100 .Now the bonus are something like this . 40 rides get an additional 25 dollars !!! Wow uber thanks .Uber in detroit i expect to earn 12 to 15 an hour grinding rides one after another back to back Tearing my car apart . Gas is 3.40 here as well . So real world profit is more in the 12 dollar range minus wear and tear . Really there is no profit . rate card uber .11 and .60 shit . Lyft its .75 and 11 . Lyft also zero bonuses .Lyft with out bonsues i expect to earn 15 an hour plus or minus Again fuel 3.20 to 3.59 here. So about 13 an hour .Mc donalds pays 16 to start here
So Uber keeps telling us reported earnings are way higher,,455212,0,
So Uber keeps telling us reported earnings are way higher,mrwhts,7303327,455212,"Yet if you google this is about right.

So Uber keeps telling us reported earnings are way higher,W00dbutcher,7304110,455212,Ever notice it always says earnings are higher then normal this time of day in the apt? Have yet to see earnings the same or lower the normal.So by this single statement earnings are always rising... But do you ever see the steady increase of earnings?
So Uber keeps telling us reported earnings are way higher,jfinks,7304969,7303327,"Not nearly enough data points to determine the actual rate of pay. I consider $ per mile more important than $ per hour. A full time driver should be able to gross about 50-60k per year. That is like 1000/1200 a week for 50 weeks a year. That is 50k-60k if done right and is largely tax free at the end of the year. But you pay your tax in the form of gas, repairs, tires, etc.I know I can go out every single day of the year (counting 50 weeks) and work 3 hours and make $75 in just 2 airport rides a day. That is over 26k per year.I think to do it right at this point is pick one platform and stick to it as much as possible to get the 2 times a week bonuses on Uber. That is 2-300 a week right there for about 80-100 trips. You should have a trip average of around $7-8. so that is 800 + bonuses. None of this includes tips, high surge amounts or 3 trip streaksYou need to keep lyft as a side chick though as it can come in handy sometimes."

My first 20 rides averaged $12.52, so that made the decision to stop easier. If I could have guaranteed myself 10 min fares, I might have continued. Since I couldn't, I cut bait.

No tips so rated all three 2 stars. lolWithout the bonus would have been $18 minus $4 for gas. Drove about 40 miles total so not bad at $1.00 per mile.So at best without bonus would have been about $14 per hour. Less if you take away full mileage deduction.

From the holding lot I messaged. He said Springfield. I was like wow....thinking that is over 3 hours one way. Looked up on the Uber app what he would pay for it and it said 205ish. I'm pretty sure he waited until that late because it was surging $13 earlier and that probably put it up over 300.I considered it and asked for a return trip fee, he said all he could afford was $20. lol. that is maybe half a tip for that trip... Told him I'd consider it for $100 extra. He said couldn't afford. Cancelled.Meanwhile I looked up what a greyhound bus would cost if I got another request. $70 leaving at 7:15am.Sure enough got another 60+ minute request and accepted so I could offer him an option. He said he didn't want to wait for a bus after I told him I'd take him to the bus station down town. Bus ride would have cost him $100 is total after adding my ride to the bus station.

Anyone pick up at airport Thursday night and take someone to Springfield?,jfinks,7271875,453245,"These were over the course of 3 times I accepted the ride. The second 2 were just so I could give him bus option. There were 2 or 3 other requests from him that I ignored. I was trying to keep my $13 surge as best I could. I ended up waiting and struck out on any rides at all, packed it in and headed home.Am curious if someone actually took him to Springfield. At the rider cost of about 205 and no surge all you would make is about $120 for 7 hours round trip driving, Gas would be about $50ish. So $10 an hour, and way less if you do the deduction on 350 miles round trip. I'd probably have done it for $250. Fare + tip + $100. But giving an ungrateful broke guy a ride that far didn't sound very fun."
Anyone pick up at airport Thursday night and take someone to Springfield?,John McYeet,7277183,453245,I would have done the same thing. Shame that there’s people out there who would do this. They keep this shitty company in business
Anyone pick up at airport Thursday night and take someone to Springfield?,jfinks,7277191,453245,"Ya not sure how it would have worked out. I was sitting on a $13 surge, but the rider price was only 205 and as low as 190. With no surge I would have made what 120-130? If Uber multiplied the surge based on distance I could have made out pretty good. But without knowing how they would calculate the surge in, only thing I could do is ask for $100 extra. If uber would have multiplied the surge they would have lost their ass on the ride."

Premium pickup??,bpsa1,3738433,247791,I think it's just to notify you of a long pick up fee when going 11+ minutes to pick somebody up on Uber. If it's above 15 minutes it will say pickup premium likely versus possible.
Premium pickup??,Mista T,3740694,3736353,"Sweat pants, 90% of my Uber attire. Gotta be comfy is right!!Pickup Premium Possible is Uber trying to put a positive spin on the fact that you will be driving much longer than normal to pick up one of their valued customers, and they MIGHT give you a few pennies extra once you pass the 10 minute mark. PPP is latin for ""ignore""."

lower pay less money being made.,jfinks,7136708,7135732,The quest for 40 - 50 rides is usually decent but if they gave a full week to reach it wouldn't be too bad. 40 rides in 3.5ish days is tough to hit sometimes especially when you are doing some Lyft.
lower pay less money being made.,mrwhts,7151071,445267,Even with the bonus the end result is very poor.And if you try to take the long ride pickups you will never make the bonus. Rising gas prices about 5 dollars a day more in gas alone.The estimate-earnings chart Uber has lies about the money being made in MO it's on average about $10.00 bucks and hour off. Do not be fooled.
lower pay less money being made.,Igimba331999,7169841,445267,"It is off quite a bit more. If we were making more than minimum wage after all the expenses of running a vehicle, Dara would buy a bunch of fleet vehicles and just pay minimum wage, but they know it costs more, so they let us bear the expense and lie about how profitable it is to be an Uber driver. Uber continues to prey on drivers that confuse cash in their pocket with income until the car breaks down and all that cash gets handed to a mechanic, or they trade in a car with only salvage value and start the game all over again with a carryover loan of the remaining balance owed on the old car."
lower pay less money being made.,mrwhts,7171833,7169841,They are double charging people for rides. I did a test the last weekend just to see if same crap going on. I was told by rider that the amount was double what it normally is. The driver gets same amount as before plus 2 bucks for surge. I picked up a person for the third time. All three rides exact same route but as of late double. On my end it was a surge for about 2 bucks yet double on riders end. Others as of late said prices have gone up on riders but drivers it's less and less. Time for a strike People.
lower pay less money being made.,Nythain,7174431,445267,"Hi.Just started rideshare a couple weeks ago. Currently with Lyft as Uber screwed up my application and wont resubmit my background check to Checkr so I'm stuck in an infinite ""Pending"" state with them. Can confirm Lyft is screwing customers and it's really hurting my pocketbook lol. I've talked to numerous customers who had no intention of tipping because they assumed I was getting a decent chunk of what Lyft is charging them.So far I'm not doing too bad in the off hours of my 9-5, but I feel it's a lot of pushing hard just to average 15-20/hr before expenses. Would probably help if Lyft offered more incentives, 3 ride streaks during a slow hour (8:30pm-9:30pm on a weeknight? really Lyft?) just doesn't cut it. I haven't seen the equivalent of a ""surge"" though I did get a ""personal power zone"" pop in the middle of nowheresville. Noped out of that real quick. I also haven't seen the equivalent of a X rides in Y days challenge either. Overall, for flat fare and the occasional tip I guess I'm not doing too bad on the earnings but those earnings should definitely be higher.Just wanted to rant a little bit with you all. I'm sticking with it as I need the extra dough and I like working in my flip-flops but was definitely a little mislead and disappointed after starting."
lower pay less money being made.,jfinks,7178255,7174431,"Don't get worked up about $ per hour. Think more about how much $per mile and maximize that. No long pickups, but semi long pickups can work out if there is a streak bonus involved. Try not to stray too far from your home, sometimes this is unavoidable. For me ,once I hit the border, I'm usually going offline or destination filtering to the airport, home or somewhere out west. Once I am east, I don't want to go further east or north to Liberty, or south to Lee's Summit if possible. A lot of times it is hard to find a destination ride back west from the far east reaches of KC. Like once I am in Grandview, next trip is usually Lee's summit pickup or Lee's summit bound with a rider... I think Lee's Summit and Liberty are very underserved, short on drivers. East KC as a whole probably is also. I try to stay out of East KC, a different breed of human exists out there, especially at night. lol. Stadium pickups can be good as long as it isn't a packed event where you sit in traffic for an hour.Avoid early morning trips to the airport unless there is a good premium on the ride. There are no inbound flights to the airport until 8:30 am pretty much every day. That means very little rides out of the airport until 8:30 or 9am."
lower pay less money being made.,jfinks,7178269,7171833,Ya I had a $13 surge ride from the airport to Leawood. Rider said it was $99 which is about 30-40 higher than normal. I got $53 from uber and she tipped 8 or so. Not too bad but ya Uber is taking up to 50% of the fare.
lower pay less money being made.,Nythain,7178278,445267,"Hey, thanks for the tips. Glad to hear and learn from others in the areaItryto avoid east kc, south east kc, and independence if possible, mostly cause i know im gonna end up with long pickups. Just recently learned grandview is a blessing and a curse lol. Went out there twice last night. Long rides were nice, and the first trip ended up snagging a long trip to the crossroads, but second trip just had me finishing my night in lees summit (didnt even know they had a downtown lol) which only sucked cause i live in nkc so ride home was wasted time and miles.Aside from a lack of hardly anyone tipping (which i feel is largely in part the fact pax think we make a good % of what they are paying already) my experiences have been great. I love to drive, and people can be very entertaining sometimes.An example of why i try to avoid large venues, had one ride to the Garth Brooks concert, right before it was supposed to start. 1hr25min of traffic. Luckily pax was super cool, walked the last .7 miles and even gave me my biggest tip that night lol. But could have gone so wrong."
lower pay less money being made.,jfinks,7179619,445267,"Ya I was in Mission around Roe and 35 on Garth Brooks night. Got a pretty good surge request for the Stadium. I just hung out at the QT there and eventually they canceled. This was around midnight, long after the concert. That's just too far to drive and I don't like going that far and risking them cancelling en route, and then have to take a lower surge ride.Tipping is so disappointing. I have a screen cap of 6 rides in a row last night with no tips. I did hit 2 $18 consecutive ride bonuses though so wasn't too bad. Later on 2 tips on the 6 rides eventually showed up. One couple I picked up in town center said it was hard to get a ride, no tip from them either. This is why it is hard to get a ride dummies. This evening I'll go back into the ride history and give 2 stars for the others that didn't tip.I did something dumb this morning and accepted a ""long trip"" at around 3:30 am. I was pretty sure it was an airport trip and it was from around 151st street in South OP. I knew what I was getting myself into when I accepted it and after taking a little break was ready for more driving. Got them to the airport around 4:15 and then camped out at the holding lot for a few hours. I left the Uber app on and at some point it picked up a $12 surge. Was able to use that at 9 am or so and took a guy to the convention center area. I did a 3 ride bonus for uber after that and headed home.So going back to what I mentioned before, I spent 11 hours in the car last night into this AM. Made about $180 or so. Per hour that sucks, but I had minimal dead miles so I'm ok with that amount. Over 4 hours of that was camped at the holding lot."
lower pay less money being made.,mrwhts,7208707,445267,11 hours in the car is worth so much more.
lower pay less money being made.,jfinks,7208790,7208707,"Ya should be, I shouldn't have taken that trip to the airport. Oh well, like I said I wasn't driving that whole 11 hours. I got lazy when I got up to the airport and just kicked back and relaxed until a plane came in around 8 or 9."
lower pay less money being made.,mrwhts,7211306,445267,"lol notice today promo are pushing people to only kill themselves. low end 20 bucks for 40 rides and 100 for 50. With long pickups impossible, If you pick and choose you lose promos."
lower pay less money being made.,Nythain,7211444,445267,Well my 20 trips is same as you (and **** that .50 per trip) but my 30+ is defo better. Uber my top tier ended at 70 trips for 260 which is still sad for the effort. I chose the 20 to 30 cause free money is free money but not killing myself for sub surge quest rewards.
lower pay less money being made.,mrwhts,7211586,7211444,40-50 trips is the lowest for $20-$100 next was 50-70 $100-$260. It's plain stupid to even try.
lower pay less money being made.,dapperstache,7212460,7178255,"Seems that way. Liberty and Lee's summit always seem to have some life, but it's never gonna be enough to get me to drive there of my own volition. I don't know what's happened, but it definately feels more dangerous in the city, particularly east of Broadway. P&L isn't the crazy center of the world it once was, and there no way in hell I'll do pickups in Westport any more. Too many shootings coming out of Throwback. Westport had the same problem back when I lived off 35th and Pennsylvania 13 years ago when the club was America's Pub. Same circus, different clowns, new name. Amazingly, the violence went down when America's pub went under, though it didn't disappear entirely.This weekend I accepted no pickups from the inner city in KCMO. I stayed south of Shawnee Mission PKWY and West of State line road, before getting sucked down as far as Stillwell. Had a nice 12 ride run there, all good rides, decent travel distances, decent pax and decent tips. Headed Northwest to Olathe where I bounced around between there, OP and Shawnee. Did a couple of airport pickups and drop offs Saturday Morning.Side note, I am seriously going to accept every reservation request the next 3 days while I am off. Maybe I can no show and get them to revoke my access to reservations."
lower pay less money being made.,jfinks,7213277,7212460,"On lyft, it won't happen, Uber will probably kick you off pretty quickly. Uber's 2 missed rides and done is pretty stiff. I could see it 2 per month and then back on. If a driver is going to take time out of their day or night to commit to a reserved ride it should be worth at least 1.5x the normal fare."
lower pay less money being made.,mrwhts,7213884,7213277,Reserved is dumb as it is. They want you online 40 min before and feed you rides that will make you late to it. Or give you a rider drunk and needs people to walk to car.On the side note did some Plyft they did a nice $115 for 15+ rides did it in about 5.5 hours on Sunday total was over 300. Problem was during Sunday to Monday got a service flag only problem I had in two ways was a pickup while dropping people off at the game. They said please hurry I paid extra to be faster. I said as nice as I could I am sorry I am still in traffic dropping off at game mihgt be a bit. She waited the whole time and had a sour face and attitude. My driving score was 99 now I think 91.
lower pay less money being made.,dapperstache,7217094,7213884,"I would have pulled over, told her that I am reporting her for asking me to violate Lyft policy AND state law. I would have screenshot it, cancelled and sent it to lyft. Who the **** do these people think they are? You text me to hurry you better bet on a smart ass response and a cancellation."
lower pay less money being made.,mrwhts,7218886,7217094,We all know reporting is useles as PUber and tlyft is today.On a side note if you get the bonus and with Tlyft streaks you can do 15 rides in about 6 hours or less as well as less miles . Compared to Pubers 10 rides 7 hours and much more miles less money. That is also based on accept all rides given.. I wanted to see how they compare and Puber is crap.

This guy was trying to get me to let him blow me the entire trip, from the bar I picked him up at to whatever shithole apartment in Roeland Park he lived in. At the end, if that cage hadn't been there, it's likely he would have tried to dry hump me. He seemingly tries to start a hug before he realizes there's a cage:DENIED MOTHER****ER!Pax was reported and had their account terminated.I prefer this over the plastic barriers, as this covers everything more solidly, and doesn't restrict airflow, so pax don't complain they are hot. Added bonus, they can slip cash through the hole. It definitely get's people's attention. Most think I am UC. I honestly can't tell you just how useful this thing is. There have been countless situations where sketchy individuals who request a ride see it and quickly nope out. I collect the fee and bounce. Also puts a stop to ""the drunk lean"". Reinforces the notion that everyone must sit in the back. The only further additions I intend to make is to get a cope light and weave it around the edge, and getting a IR Baby Mirror (Camera) so I can see the cabin without craning my neck to look in the mirror.

"Reservations were always bad, but now they are *really* f'ing bad.",dapperstache,7209609,7209539,"Yeah, I noticed they've not only gone way down in price but in request frequency. I used to have 7 or 8 each morning (that already got claimed) that I'd have to sift through when I got up. Then, when Uber had their glitch that erroneously labeled drivers who were online and ready to start a reservation as being offline, I was inadvertently blacklisted from reservations. I spent 2 weeks going back and forth with agents whose name I can't pronounce, none of whom read the previous discourse. Finally I got one with more than 3 braincells and he reactivated Reservations, before warning me on accepting and never showing. I was so beyond exasperation. I wish I had just let them black list me. Maybe I will make it a point to accept a couple and purposely no show so I will stop getting them. I am still seeing plenty of them come at me in pings that other drivers obviously rejected. Who is seriously going to accept a ping that is $4-$8?"
"Reservations were always bad, but now they are *really* f'ing bad.",jfinks,7209671,449380,"I mean if you aren't far away a 4-8 ping is fine, a lot of times they are just going a few miles for that.

I think I have one strike against me on Uber reservations, Lyft doesn't seem to care. Lyft pissed me off a while back and I was on the other side of town.

Is this posted anywhere? Or a violation of some civil right (discrimination)? I am new to driving Uber (less than a month) and want to protect my investment (car) and the general safety of my riders - as any tenured driver would. Any insight appreciated!Below is a template I created I want to use.FOR EVERYONE’S SAFETY, the below are NOT permitted and should request cancellation/a new ride within the next 5 minutes to avoid new fees (trip canceled upon arrival otherwise):• Intoxicated riders; especially with alcoholic odor.• Under-weather riders (Excessive Coughing, Nauseous, Sneezing, etc.)• More than 3 riders (all rear).

Sick & Intoxicated Riders,dapperstache,7202970,448947,"Whatever you are comfortable with is where the line is. Regarding intoxicated pax specifically, I have a set of rules I follow.-In Power and Light, if the pax isn't flagging me down as I pull up, I cancel. It's extremely unsafe to be parked on those narrow streets for more than 10 seconds.-Westport I generally avoid anymore. Between shootings and Ztrip having a contract with the city, AND KCPD deciding they can just **** us by blocking off access to the designated pickup location, Westport just isn't worth it.-I added a text shortcut on my tablet that sends every pax a message ""Just a reminder that Uber only insures Uber X rides for 3 passengers. If you have more than 3 passengers, you will need to cancel and order an Uber XL."" 99% will cancel immediately.-If I pull up and see 4 riders approaching, I drive away, park in a safe location and collect the fee.-If I see anyone stumbling, drooling, being assisted, etc, I cancel as unsafe pickup.-Absolutely no open drinks. Drinks in hand are a red flag for me to drive away. Same with food. I'm not a party bus. Any traffic that crosses the KS border with an open container is doing so illegally.-The last one should go without saying, but absolutely and always keep your doors locked until you have verified the person is the correct one, and that you are comfortable giving this person a ride. You can markanyride where safety may be jeopardized in any way as an unsafe pickup and it will not affect your cancellation rate. AFAIAC, someone potentially puking in my car during a pandemic is definitely unsafe, as is picking up 4 people in an X (not to mention the potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars you'll be out if you get in a wreck driving Uber X with 4 people.)I'd recommend getting a pet divider.

If Uber leaves it at 3 riders for X, but allows X drivers to receive XL rates for 4 riders (like XL guys can do if they accept an X ping and see that five guys pile in), two things will happen.1) X drivers will make more money for the 4 rider X rides.2) More XL vehicles will get on the road because there will be greater demand.After all, if a rider is going to get charged XL rates for 4 people, might as well order an XL.If they did that, I might drag the Enclave out to drive on Friday and Saturday nights and run XL only.[NG]Owner"

The other night I showed up to the lot and there was a bunch of cars there. They app showed 1-5 Uber X. As soon as a $24 surge hit, about 30 cars were showing in the app. lol Only 3-4 new cars showed up. I was already online so got out of there quick.

Can’t see the amount of UberX cars and I see a bunch of cars here but only 6-10 in queue.There must be some sort of correlation between the broken queue and higher airport surge. Because since they switched back to flat surge pricing, I haven’t seen the airport go past $16 surge.if that’s the case I hope the queue is never fixed."
Anyone notice the number of UberX cars in the MCI lot isn't showing?,jfinks,7166477,446980,"I've seen $22 and $24 surges at night recently, but less frequently. A lot of the cars in queue are XLs, they are waiting on XL only rides.Not sure if it is purposely broken, kinda dumb in my opinion cause I usually head to the airport if I am close already if the X number is less than 10. Depends on time though. Get close to 1am and the number of flights coming in dwindles, then stops about 1:30am. Usually there are some late arrivals though from delayed flights."

A few minutes later I logged back on and surge was $14. I got in the queue about 1-5, then magically there was 16-20 cars, then 25-30 cars. Only a few cars came into the lot.Lyft had very few drivers. I could decline on Lyft, get kicked offline, then be back online and in front of queue.

I'm on the fence on what to do on those. Since I was 1-5 on Uber I tend to wait and get the surge ride. If I was 16 and up and getting late I might take the Lyft long trip. Lyft long trips can be misleading, had one that just went down to midtown east. Right at 30 minutes. No tip so 1 starred her. lol. No Tip No ride...A couple weeks ago the app showed a 16 surge at the lot, but out at 435 and mexico intersection it was 31. It did this for a couple days. I left the lot and ""touched base"" at Mexico to pick up the 31 surge then headed back to the lot. lol. Kind of a pain but was worth it. It hasn't done it since so must have been a glitch in the matrix. I think it was around the 4th of july. Unfortunately I didn't get any good rides out of it. Went to Weston once, then back dead miles. Same with Parkville and back, the only thing that made it worth it was the 31 surge. Then had another short ride to a hotel along ambassador drive.

A Tip to Avoid Being Logged Out after Three Declines,,444308,0,
A Tip to Avoid Being Logged Out after Three Declines,NGOwner,7119663,444308,"So we all know that Uber will log you out of the app after you decline three rides.I learned from another post that if you go offline briefly on the first or second second decline, then go back online immediately, you reset the three strikes counter.Sometimes I couldn't get the go offline screen up fast enough before the third ping came in. The following tip should help with that.Right after you go online, bring up the go offline screen and leave it up. When a ping comes in, the app will revert back to the map showing you where the pickup is.If you decline the ping, or let it time out, the app will revert back to the go offline screen with the button there waiting to be hit.And in bonus news, the go offline button in my experience takes precedence over ping acceptance. So if, during that brief time the ping causes the app to switch to map view, and you hit go offline, you will, rather than accept that third ping.You're welcome.[NG]Owner"
A Tip to Avoid Being Logged Out after Three Declines,jfinks,7121304,7119663,"I've tried the go offline thing and it doesn't always lose count. Uber even counts 2 missed reservations as missed requests. I went online and missed one and it logged me out.Lyft must have a couple modes depending on demand. Usually it kicks you offline after 2 missed. The other night I stopped lyft because uber was surging big time. Lyft wouldn't quit sending back to back requests. They came in so fast I couldn't even go offline. lol. I think it cycled through over 200 requests, I turned the volume down it was getting annoying. I run uber on a tablet, lyft on phone...."
A Tip to Avoid Being Logged Out after Three Declines,jfinks,7151225,7119663,Running uber app in landscape mode on a tablet makes this easier. You never have to scroll to see the Go offline button or Stop new requests button. It is always on the right 1/3 of the screen.

Every once in a while Uber screws up and the app functions the way it's supposed to and I jump right in and make some good money. Otherwise, I've been driving Lyft and using the passenger app to check for surge pricing if things are slow with them. I was downtown last week and Uber was offering a ride from the Cigar Box to Sprint Center (if you don't know, they're maybe 300 yards from each other) for around $22. So I signed in and got a request immediately but there was no surge money attached. I cancelled it, went back online and got another request - again with no surge money. But then I looked down in the corner and it said ""3.7x"". I figured what the hell - so I completed the ride and sure enough I was paid just over $20 for a quick 5 or 6 mile trip. I've probably done like 7 trips for Uber in the past 10 days and they were all surge pricing but with a multiplier and not a fixed dollar amount.Changing the entire surge pricing structure without so much as a text to the drivers sounds like the the Uberest thing ever. I'm in no way surprised. But I don't see any mention of it in the forums. I'm starting to wonder if they're considering bringing the multiplier back and this is some sort of dry run.

No more flat dollar amounts attached to surge pricing?,Jimmy44,7121409,7121310,Uber is really suffering in my area as riders and drivers are getting wise to there high fees and lack of fairly sharing with drivers.I drive during the day when surges really don't come into play.You are doing a good job reading your area and responding to what is offered.Good luck and be safe !

That was a month ago. Now they are still claiming that it is a glitch. So is the consensus that they've replaced dollar surge with no heat map and multiplier + personal surge?Also, personal surge... every time I get the offer to drive to it, as soon as I accept it throws me non surge requests, which I decline. After 3 no surge requests, it kicks me off. Not to mention, the requests have all been in the opposite direction of personal surge. Perhaps I'm being a noob about the personal surge? We've had it since the beginning of the month, and I didn't see it until yesterday, and I drive mostly full time."

On the Kansas side, watch out for speed traps in the college towns (Manhattan, Lawrence).Mission and Fairway police seem to be the most ticket-happy in the area, especially on Shawnee Mission Pkwy, Johnson Dr, and 63rd St, but I've had a Mission officer specifically tell me ""I don't ticket Uber drivers.""KCMO police generally leave you alone, but watch out for westport at 1am. These morons have no idea what they're doing. They close down many of the roads at some point, and last week an officer told me to come on through and just let me know that I was Uber. This week a different officer gave me a ticket with a mandatory court appearance for it.Generally speaking, the rich areas are gonna have cops that just try to ticket as many people passing through as possible because they have nothing better to do. In the rougher areas I wouldn't worry about a speeding ticket, but you have to worry about other things...I've not had any issues with any of the other departments."

Uber XL worth Driving in KC,NGOwner,7092077,442490,"There are surely a few. I'm not one of them.My belief is that it is probably not worthwhile to acquire a vehicle than can do XL unless its <$5k (which would eliminate Comfort as an option).Right now it might be ok, if you can live with running only XL. Because its busy out there on X, especially on Fr/Sa/Su. Lots of pings, lots of surges. But you have to be picky (my AR/CR is 15%/7%). I am brutal when it comes to which rides I'll take.If you just run XL, these are the only rides you'll get:1) Those rides that are truly 4+ people2) Those that cannot wait (or cannot get) an X ride because it is too busy.3) Or those smart people that check out XL from an expense perspective, e.g., cheaper to go XL than pay surging X rates.And XL doesn't typically surge (I'm just guessing here, I don't drive XL). Which sometimes makes X more expensive than XL.And if you don't exclusively run XL, 95% of your fares will be X anyway. So what's the point then?And I expect profitability to change drastically once the free federal cheese expires. Then the drivers will likely start coming back, driving supply way up, and our earnings (comparatively to now) way down.[NG]Owner"

Rider question-long trip?,Baby Yoda's Coffee,6602048,417634,"Hi everyone. I was looking into Uber for a 250 mile trip. However, when digging deeper, I found that a driver may not even know about the request until the day of. I wouldn't expect a driver to want to jump into a 250 mile trip without any notice and the trip is important to me (visiting family) and I would need to be sure it was going to happen. Are Uber drivers even interested in such a trip, even with notice? If so, is there any way at all to give a heads up to any interested drivers so if they are interested, they have time to plan ahead? I would also need a ride back home approximately 1 week after the trip. The 2 trips would occur in late December. I just don't even want to put in a reservation for the 2 trips unless I can be sure I have a ride to and from (and to also give the potential driver time to plan and make arrangements for a 250 mile trip). I am in Topeka and would be going 250 miles south. Thank you so much for reading and I look forward to any tips, info, advice....just anything at all, that you can spare.:smiles: Thank you again! 👍"

UE Question,jfinks,6583651,416161,"I think it just depends on how busy it is. If it is really busy there might be enough deliveries to give them out by driver stats. There are most likely several factors that go into who gets the ping, location probably being the main one. The main goal would be to get the food as fast as possible and to the customer. There might be some factors like delaying order pickup based on historical data of when the place has things ready. This would require the system to predict who might be closest in 10 minutes. I'm sure it is a very complex and fluid algorithm."

Most of the new development has been on the KS side. That said MO has some of the oldest and affluent areas in the City. From what I see if you are planning on Apartment living, choose the Overland Park/Lenexa area (that is KS side) or North up by Zona Rosa (that is MO) side. If looking for a house then it can be a toss up, just depends on how much house you can buy and how big or small of house you are looking for.I'd consider full time driving is 6-10 hours per day, depending on the day. Probably 40-50 hours a week. Part time driver 20-30 hours per week. Consider delivery with Eats, Door Dash etc. as it can pay more than driving with way less milage driven.

With rise of gas costs and the lack of surges, it's not worth it anymore."
The surge is gone?,jfinks,6522961,413077,Think we are seeing a large amount of drivers and a lot fewer riders. Lots working from home or out of work. Schools doing online stuff.
The surge is gone?,PeterT,6524169,6522961,I hear you. And I agree. There have got to be a lot of drivers are coming back recently.But I don't think they all came back Wednesday morning. This happened very suddenly. We had big patches of map that would glow hot pink for up to $10 or $12 all throughout the day and night for months and then all the sudden on Wednesday they don't get any bigger than a couple of square blocks and go higher than than 2or 3??
The surge is gone?,jfinks,6524238,413077,The surge is automatically driven so a sudden surge of drivers vs typical amount of riders can suddenly drop the surge. Bad thing in all this is riders can still be charged surge rates and you'd never know it unless you ask each rider what they are being charged. It is possible that Wednesday a recalibration of the KC market happened. This is where they look at data and input new parameters in an algorithm.

The surge is gone?,jfinks,6527219,413077,"I would for a decent bonus. About a month ago Uber had a $40 for 3 trip bonus. I was like hell ya, got my car cleaned up and busted that out in less than 2 hours. Think it ended up being $72 or so. Here's the thing, no surge but one rider commented that he was quoted over $20. He got canceled on like 3 times before me. I told him it was because he was at a hotel and no drivers wanted to risk a trip to the Airport, he thought for a bit and said that had to be it. I looked back on the trip data and Uber reported he was charged $11. The app isn't even reporting the correct rider amount. It shouldn't matter I guess, except for the fact that the rider thinks the driver is getting over $7 per mile and isn't likely to tip."

I really hate the rating system/rider comments from Uber,jbudb,3613125,240191,So I've been rocking along with no problems with any pax. Out of the blue I get a rating of 1 with a vague comment about professionalism. I can't think of anyone who may have been unhappy over the past few weeks. The comment is infuriating in its lack of any helpful information and Uber's apparent belief that I must have done something wrong. I guess I'll be stuck at a 4.86 for at least another 500 rides. It sucks that we get accused of some bad behavior and have no voice in the matter.
I really hate the rating system/rider comments from Uber,NGOwner,3613494,240191,"499 five stars and one 1 star won't equal a 4.86 rating.If you click on your actual rating on the ratings screen, you'll see a breakdown of how your ratings are distributed. At least it does on Android.That all being said, as hard as it is, disregard the ratings. There's only one thing about ratings that's important. Being above the deactivation line (And you are still WAAAAY above it).I know how hard it is. Each time I get a ding, whatever it may be, it pisses me off. But I know that you can't please everyone all of the time. So I try to zen out and accept. But it doesn't always work and I get angry again. Dumb ass entitled passengers. Ungrateful ingrates. And then I try the zen thing again. And the cycle repeats. It's like that scene inA Fish Called Wandawhen Kevin Kline catches John Cleese robbing his own house (if you haven't seenA Fish Called Wanda,you have to. One of the funniest damn movies ever! Chuckling now just thinking about it.).And then finally those dings go away after a week and calm is restored.[NG]Owner(sitting at a 4.93 driver rating that, in the grand scheme of things, means absolute and total bupkis.)"
I really hate the rating system/rider comments from Uber,gambler1621,3616359,240191,"I find that if I rate all pax a 3 (that's average right?), then make them earn additional stars, it helps tremendously. To earn 5 stars a pax must do ALL of the following:Be waiting outside when i arriveEfficiently enter and exit the carNo Body OdorNo food or drink in car without permissionLet the driver drive and navigate unless asked for adviceDon't distract driverEnter the correct pickup and drop off point.No multiple stops unless entered into ride initially.Be a nice, pleasant person while you are in my car.Violate any of these and the pax will make no better than a 4 rating, violate 2 and stay at a 3, violate more, and rating drops.When you realize ratings are just a game, you will quit worrying so much. Next time you pay your utility bill at home, ask them if they accept Uber stars as payment. That will keep it in perspective.Ratings only count when you drop to deactivation level. They don't pay the bills. Some pax are a$$holes and will rate you low no matter what. Most will rate you 5 stars unless you do something to deserve a lower rating.DRIVE ON AND HAVE FUN WITH IT."

I really hate the rating system/rider comments from Uber,jbudb,3617588,3613494,"You misunderstood my comment about 500 rides. The ratings are based on your last 500 rides. That is why I said I'd have to wait that long. You should also know that not every pax rates us. I am fairly new and have only driven 892 rides. Of the last 500, only 428 were rated. 424 of them were 5 with two 4s and a three added to the 1 that was the genesis of this thread. I haven't checked the math, but Uber says that is a 4.86.I do the same thing when I get one of these. It pisses me off and I get really frustrated.

It's all a crap shoot on rider ratings. On one hand it is tough for a lot of drivers to rate lower and that makes me think if they have a low rating they must have been really bad at some point. On the other hand newer riders are 5star, so they are an unknown. I am more choosy in bar sections of town on ratings than say at the airport. I picked up a rider at the airport and she was a 4.45 or something low like that. It was airport so you kinda gotta take what you can get in the queue. She was fine as a rider, no issues. She was from New York in for a conference so maybe New York drivers rate low all the time. I don't know, it is hard to put a lot of decision on the rating. I am more about distance to pickup, that I am strick about. No more than about 2-3 miles or 6-8 minutes max, unless it is a good surge ride (1.5x and up)."

I'm generally not going to wait until the wedding is over unless I am being paid to wait, and not uber pay.I cover up any smells with some Peppermint essential oils.I log into the apps to do rides and see that all pickups are way too far away, I just shut it down. I have done some Uber eats/Door Dash for 2-3 hours at a time when rates are good. I don't like after dark because apartments are so hard to find. Late in the evening DoorDash will start sending you requests to go deliver to Grandview or mid town. Nope, not going that far, once in Grandview you'll end up getting deliveries to Lee's Summit/Belton, Just Nope... I try not to go further out than about State line road. I have broken this a couple times when a $20-30 delivery pops up. Then one time I have a $33 hooters delivery, got there and all police and fire trucks, some type of kitchen fire.Now that I got my back pay from the state and feds and the EIDL grant and loan I am pretty much taking some time off. Doing some work around my house, finally got my hot tub fixed, (about $1000 lol) I will assess things at the end of July when the payments taper off."

I really hate the rating system/rider comments from Uber,jfinks,6345269,240191,"part of it is at getkansasbenefits.gov. If you qualify for the state unemployment you automagically get the 600 a week. I got a lump sum backdated to end of march. Just becareful on how much you work because you can lose the benefit if work too much.The EIDL is from SBA.gov. The loan from SBA is optional, take it if you need it. 3% interest and 30 years to pay it off isn't bad."

I really hate the rating system/rider comments from Uber,jfinks,6345538,240191,The EIDL is a 1000 grant. You can also apply for up to a 10000 loan. I got about half of that 10k as a loan.

I'd suggest you print up some business cards promoting your IT skills and hand them out to every person you come into contact for 1 month. I bet the response to your cards will more than replace your lost income from fuber.Speaking from experience, ( I'm one of the original geeks, even have a couple of dated patents in my name ) your trying to compete with lots of other drivers for a limited amount of monies, and you have nothing the other drivers don't have. Promote you, your in IT, why ? Are you any good ? How strong is your voodoo ? Monopolize on your skills that are unique, driving is not one of them. For over 10 years I ran a small computer consulting business, with my services focused on the small business, never paid a cent for advertising, just business cards and word of mouth. If your any good, that's where your $ is waiting for you, not driving cheap ass pax to where ever and back."

"What's the market like now, is it picking up a bit?",tmart,6311571,402485,I've taken the last 6 months off and wondering if things have picked up lately
"What's the market like now, is it picking up a bit?",jfinks,6311683,402485,"Not really, maybe a little. I test the market by turning apps online and see how far away the average pings are. Usually minimum 10 minutes, and up to 20 minutes away is the norm. Mask wearing is a pain and so far riders haven't complied, but that was as of 2 weeks ago when I gave a few rides. Tips are horrible still, riders feel entitled to cheap rides now."
"What's the market like now, is it picking up a bit?",kcdrvr15,6312273,402485,"Well, on the taxi side, I would say my business has increased...June 2020 ( to date ) +198.9% over June 2019 to date. The total fares are up, but average fare is down. I'm getting more $30-$40 fares and less the $80 plus fares. I did start working the airport taxi que for some arrivals but most of my business is to the airport.  This increase is due to lack of competition, not increased demand. I'm out every morning and evening, and I will say there are more people moving about, but not like it was before the disruption."
"What's the market like now, is it picking up a bit?",jfinks,6312301,402485,"Part of it is the mask wearing thing, I know I'm done with this for the most part until that changes. DoorDash doesn't seem to care, and of course uberEats you don't have to wear one. A bag of food can't report you, I think restaurants can though, but haven't had a problem with that. On the rider side uber just sucks. Every time you want to go online you have to take a picture wearing a mask. Just dumb as hell. Lyft is more sensible, just agree to wear one then it doesn't ask again, for now. Uber even asks for a selfie pic if you don't go online right after taking one. Just stupid.The other part is the rates are pre covid rates where pickups distances were shorter and there were more requests. This creates lots of extra dead miles in two ways. One, dead miles picking up, and two, a higher chance of taking someone way to the outskirts and much less chance of getting another ride. Airport is an example now, take someone to the airport and then nothing. Effectively you are driving for 30 cents per mile then."

No drivers after 10-11pm???,tmart,6130232,393292,"I drive for Uber occasionally but my car is in the shop right now, I work somewhere second shift so I get off work at 11 in Johnson County area, I've had a hard time getting an Uber at 11, so have to wait an hour or two - frequently getting the no cars available message the last few days. When and if I finally do get a ride , the drivers are telling me theyve busy all night long but only the last few days , so if you've got a car that gets 30 miles to the gallon city, now just might be your time. Uber knows the customers who need a ride to and from work every day they have that data, and they could intervene logistically to ensure that we can get rides to and from work, the Uber system needs Improvement."
No drivers after 10-11pm???,jfinks,6138270,393292,"Rates need to at least double for me to take rides now. The current rates are based on continuous trips because of the amount of requests and generally short pickup distances. Whenever I turn on the uber or lyft app I never see a pickup less than 12 minutes, usually it is 15 to 20. Not going to do it not knowing how far they are going. Uber/Lyft need to get rid of their stupid worthless points system and show pickup and drop offs for every ride.There is risk also, so I would say rates should be tripled to make it worth doing and even then i'd be very picky who I let in the car and where I picked up. If riders complain of price gouging, tell them to go buy some nice new walking shoes."

I don't think many rides are being given because the same names pop up even after 15-20 min.Last night I tried accepting a couple pings to be able to contact the riders. First one was about 20 min away and I messaged I was ""stuck in traffic"". She Lol'd, but I told her it was a restaurant Drive thru. She ended up canceling. Next one was 17 min away over in north Leawood. Same story from me, she said she would pay $20 up front if I came and got her, she was going to 194th and Metcalf. Wow, would have been a decent pay, but going to be stuck in nowhereville. She cancelled. Third one I got busted on with same story, she said no problem she could wait, ""thanks for driving tonight"".... It was at a medical center about 20 min away, she was getting off work. I eventually got her to cancel.After that I got a nasty gram from Lyft saying my acct was at risk because of poor service.Quite frankly lyft, the current operational model doesn't work, rates don't work and there is a high risk of infection which warrants significant hazard pay but that isn't even really worth the risk.I haven't had a rider in my car for about a month.

No drivers after 10-11pm???,kcdrvr15,6263061,393292,"One of the reasons there are no cars available, is the rate of pay is below minimum wage. You want quick fast service, but not willing to pay. This is why the system needs improvement, you need to pay more to maintain a reliable service. If the rate is below what I get for taxi/car service, I will just watch the pings time out, and when the rider gets tired of trying to get an uber/lyft and then calls me, I quote them a surge price. Whats keeping the rates from going up is all the chumps getting pimped out by uber or as they call them here on this forum, ants."
No drivers after 10-11pm???,jfinks,6263563,6263061,"Ya I can't understand why there isn't much surge. It has to be some type of price gouging situation they are trying to avoid.I went to the uber rider app the other night while eating some nuggets around college and quivira. I think this was a Friday at 11 or 12 at night. I put a destination in 2-3 miles away, cost was 9$. No cars available, every once and a while a car would pop up 18 minutes away.I imagine this situation will recover over the next month or 2. But still the rates make 0 sense with the amount of rider demand and distance between. I think Uber/Lyft are caught up in this and can't raise rates. Imagine if all the sudden Costco doubled the price of TP. The outrage and bad press, etc."

Several food spills due to poor packaging, me eating in car when get a chance. Was not looking good for having passengers. Spent a few hours on it yesterday and looking good. Think I'll hit the road and take a few riders tomorrow.One thing that popped up on uber yesterday was a trip estimate for a ride. I didn't accept since this was before the clean up. It was $4 and 1.5 miles total on the screen. I know it was a ride and not a delivery because it timed out very quickly unlike a delivery."
Got my car all cleaned up.,jfinks,6283300,401073,"I think I was mistaken, that was just a $4 surge amount. Didn't think Uber was smart enough to actually give an ""independent contractor"" info about a ride. Anyway, did one ride tonight, drove 3.5 miles to pick up at an apartment. Round trip to quiktrip and back. Had a little surge going going so made a little extra on it. No tip so far. Of course my default 1 star rating for every rider still applicable. Had the lyft app going on my tablet, it was going nutz with requests 15-20 minutes away. I was on college blvd and was getting requests at legends, grandview, raytown, and plaza. Wow. rideshare is dead. My lyft acceptance rate is like 1% or 2% last time I checked. I think it bottomed out and just can't get any lower."
Got my car all cleaned up.,jfinks,6287564,401073,"Looks like I am talking to myself. loll. Anyway took 2 more rides last night right before which the loop on my mask broke...I kinda faked it on until I saw the riders didn't have masks either...A little longer pickups than I like but was $7 surge for both of them. First pickup over in south Leawood. Strike one, rider tries to get in the front seat. I say no one is supposed to ride in front, only 3 riders allowed. They had 4 but one decided not to go so three in the back, no one had masks. I showed him in the rider app on my phone where it said 3 in X. He said his phone didn't show that, most likely bs, so whatever. Took the trip and dropped off.Next was at hospital south of Metcalf and 119th. Picked up and dude with stuffed backpack tried to get in front seat. I had stuff on seat and said no one is supposed to sit in front. He got in back. No mask, no issues during ride. I was done after that though, accidently accepted another trip while ending another. Just canceled that one and went home.Uber is obviously dropping the ball on letting riders know what the new rules are. I think it is more that the riders don't care though."
Got my car all cleaned up.,BostonTaxiDriver,6291207,0,"Are riders being told of the new rules only after they book the ride?Because when I check Uber out of curiosity, there's no notice or warning about masks or 3 pax max when I get the price but not book any ride.So maybe it's only mentioned after officially confirming the ride?Maybe it was a one-time e-mail to all pax?"

The best part of food delivery is knowing mileage and locations before accepting. I don't see myself giving many rides until rideshare does the same and I recommend everyone else to do the same.I turn Lyft on every once and a while as kind of a test. Lets see how far away the first pickup is..... Usually 13-20 minutes away. I am by JCCC, and typically get requests in Grandview, Plaza, Waldo, far south OP/Olathe, even get requests close to Legends.... Not gonna do it. One night I was curious where the riders are going so I texted them. Actually the rides were decent and they offered 20$ to come get them. But not gonna do it and get stuck 30 miles from home with no new rides.Lyft lowered rates on KS side right at the start of all this, bad timing since I probably would have taken some of those trips at KS rates.I know riders are having a tough time getting rides because some nights I turn app on and see what rides/names come in.

After a few minutes Lyft will throw you a pickup 15-20 minutes away. No thanks. Maybe at the old rate i'd try it.One of the reasons for lower rates is trying to get more requests. Now that requests are few and far between it is a total waste of time risking getting 30min from home with no other rides."

I set my taxi meter to $5 flag drop, $2.90 mile, and $.50 min wait time, and I added $10 to all my flat rate fares. The key to surviving during these times is be flexible and don't sell yourself short. This is the time to be out marketing your services, getting your car repaired or cleaned up. There are going to be lots of disruptions this next year, and with these ""disruptions"" will come lots of new opportunities, if you snooze, you lose.There are only 2 kinds of people, Winners and Losers, the difference is the winners don't stop trying."
Lyft chose a bad time to lower rates.,jfinks,6038751,6037527,"That's nice but few people would take a round trip to Excelsior Springs for example at those rates. They just wouldn't go if that was the only option. Lyft was actually a decent paying gig on the KS side until this last round of cuts. Now it just marginally better than uber, ride pickups are way farther that uber. So basically before I might drive a little further to pickup a lyft rider, but now my pickup radius is under 3 miles just like uber. Sometimes I will go up to 4-5 miles if it is all highway and is still under 8 minutes pickup time.The weird thing is I looked up the Uber payout on that trip, I made 72, but the app said uber only charged like $64 or something silly like that. The rider should have been charged like $100 at least. I asked the rider if she made this trip often and she said she did so I gave her my number to see if we can do a cash deal. Problem is if Uber is only quoting 64, this won't work. I was going to tell her I'd do it for $80 cash. I make a little more and she saves a little."

Kinda miffed at this point. Then the ""Hurry"" message when I am about 8 min away. I stewed a little and contemplated, probably going 2 miles and no tip. So I canceled about 5 min away as I drove past my house. I was like nope not at these rates now. Have fun walking."

Lyft chose a bad time to lower rates.,jfinks,6064211,387873,"Ya, I didn't feel spiteful at all. Lyft just significantly cut rates. I'm pretty sure this was at a grocery store that means lots of stuff to haul. Combine that with no tips, probably short distance, the messages, and I just drove by my house, it was an easy decision."

Just sayin ive seen you roaming the terminals. Its easily noticeable. when all the taxis wait in a line and all the towncars have to pay for parking and have there own lot... And some white subaru is driving in circles around the terminal with no parking permit and no white sheet of paper on the dash. Airport security may not notice. Drivers do. What your doing is illegal. Taxis cannot solicit at KCI and they cannot be flagged down. There is a phone inside specifically for cabs.I really feel like anyone who has the permits and is in the control tower regularly. would be aware of these simple rules. Maybe not who knows. I can say this alot of people know that vehicle. I knew what car it was before you verified it. must be another coincidence.

Took someone downtown from the airport for 15 dollars. It used to be 20. Why on gods earth they would reduce rates out of the airport is beyond me. You wait two hours and most customers are on business travel. There really is no reason to lower rates.

I think they may have lowered Surge threshold in the areas outside City Center... no way it was actually that busy... i mean, i've driven almost every friday night for the last 2 years, and I've never seen JOCO light up like this at 5:30 on a friday evening. And it seemed to do this all night on friday and saturday nights at super random times. Either they lowered the surge threshold, or all the drivers were just sticking inside city center because of the new rates. I did really well on friday and saturday this weekend and I still spent most of my time outside the city center area"

I think my Uber x days are over but I will start running lyft every morning now.

Upcoming Changes to Rates in KC= Sucks,jfinks,5984594,382128,"What are Uber Lawrence rates now? Uber Lawrence rates were the same as Lyft's, 94.5 per mile. The new Lyft rates are what the Uber rates were in KC so that is better at least but not a lot. What happened is Lyft all the sudden saw a spike in the availability of drivers on their platform so no need to keep the rates higher. Lawrence drivers get the worst part of this as the rides are always very short and you needed that higher rate to make it worth it after the booking fee is taken out."

Feel free to post screenshots for comparison since I can only see the rate card in 'my' designated area.The only silver lining (if you're optimistic and/or half-glass-full type) is that we aren't yet getting hit with the poverty earning rates seen in Phoenix and Minneapolis/St. Paul from a while back-either way, a polished turd is still a turd."

New MCI waiting Lot,John McYeet,5885125,379356,I saw this. I guess it’s good they’re separating everyone because I was going to say if I get jumped by a taxi driver I’d hope my Uber friends jump in and help me. :roflmao:
New MCI waiting Lot,jfinks,5885178,379356,"Ya, not sure if the separation is that significant... and they are putting the ztrips etc with the Uber/Lyfts. ztrip is way more comparable to a traditional taxi service than a TNC.I am sure they have ample security cams and possible on site security. I think it is good for the drivers and riders. It is less than half the distance and I don't think there is a ticket system (that remains to be seen). Nice to have some bathrooms, hopefully a vending area. I'm sure I'm not the only one that has had to ""wet the pavement"" while waiting over 2 hours for a ride. lol."
New MCI waiting Lot,John McYeet,5885340,379356,"Yeah, same to be honest. I’m thinking after the nasty foreign taxi drivers and nasty Uber drivers have their way with the new restrooms they won’t stay nice for very long. Doubtful cleaning them will be much of a priority for local airport janitors."
New MCI waiting Lot,NGOwner,5890420,379356,"The real question (which FlyKCI can't answer) is: With the new staging area now closer in proximity to the terminals, will ReMatch on Uber and Lyft still work?Because if Lyft and Uber kill ReMatch, airport runs just became a whole bunch less interesting.[NG]Owner"
New MCI waiting Lot,John McYeet,5890534,379356,It’s about half the distance it was at lot C. Was there last night and no one could figure out where to go. Wonder if they have the building open yet. Almost looked like a lounge you could wait in while you wait for a ride but I can’t confirm that.
New MCI waiting Lot,jfinks,5890755,5890420,"I don't think they will kill rematch, no real reason to, but it is nice to be a little closer to the terminals. Half the distance to get staged and more like 1/3rd the distance to get to terminal since don't have to go all the way to ticket booths.As of this morning lyft hadn't updated their geofence, Uber was updated at 12am. I haven't been out yet today but may have to go check things out. Sucks it is 37 miles for me to get there. Probably wont today since it is a federal holiday and things might be a little slower.I was hoping for a QT to open there. Gas, snacks, etc. It would probably close down that other craphole texaco thing though."
New MCI waiting Lot,jfinks,5891195,379356,Looks like lyft updated the queue area.
New MCI waiting Lot,John McYeet,5892435,379356,I’m wondering why the airport has been surging all day even though there’s been nonstop 60+ cars waiting in the queue.
New MCI waiting Lot,gambler1621,5893309,379356,It was surging because I was not there.
New MCI waiting Lot,jfinks,5894330,5892435,"I made my way up to the lot last night. 56-60 in the queue. Lot was pretty full at about 9pm, but there were a few spots to park. Had a $4 bonus as I approached and that went up to $15 while waiting in queue. I think it was about an hour and half wait. Watched some youtube tv while was in lot. Bathrooms weren't too destroyed yet. No tickets or gate as of yet. No food, but I'm wondering if you can walk over to the Marriott and grab a snack from the lobby. Would be cool to see if some food trucks are able to come up to the airport, if it is even allowed.As far as ride bonus all day, I'm sure there are many factors. Day of week, time of day, amount in queue. Through machine learning and pre programming the app can maintain an optimum level of drivers. It is possible they try to block out Lyft by keeping a bonus on the screen since a large portion of drivers do both concurrently. It is kind of interesting being in both lyft and uber queues. If Uber has 50 in queue, lyft usually has about half that amount. But as you reach the front of the line on Lyft, uber usually is at 1-5 or so. I think a lot of the lyft movement is just uber trips taken before they get a lyft ride."
New MCI waiting Lot,John McYeet,5899984,379356,Been kind of weird this week with the new lot. Am there now (Wednesday night) and there’s 101-105 cars here. In my year and a half of driving I’ve very rarely seen it that bad. Plus there’s no more stalls so people are parking in front of people. I’m not sure if this lot will work unless they plan on expanding or working out these random surge happenings because I’m thinking a lot of people are here just because they expect the surge to happen like it’s been this week.
New MCI waiting Lot,jfinks,5900275,379356,"Its almost like they updated the lot geofence but didn't update the surge area. Surge is constantly seeing 0 drivers in queue? Over 100 is crazy on a Wed night, I was watching earlier and saw 80. Last night there was 60 at 12:30Am. There isn't much surge worth waiting over 2 hours for. There is more money to be made driving. Ya the lot was pretty full even with 60 in queue, remember that is only what uber is showing. There could be 20-30 lyft only cars also. That makes for a possible 130-140 cars in the lot. Crazy. I didn't count the spots, I imagine it is around 80."
New MCI waiting Lot,John McYeet,5900336,379356,Yeah I’d imagine 80-90. 100 stalls at best but That’s still almost 40-50 short. I’m waiting for the first fender bender since the lanes are so small and cars already come flying around corners.
New MCI waiting Lot,jfinks,5900448,379356,"Ya I watch this Youtuber's Channel in Chicago, they have a lot like KC has now. It gets pretty crazy. Problem is you have to stay in that little area or get kicked out of queue so there isn't much choice. Almost going to need a queue to get into the queue. Once lot is full, one goes in when one goes out. That means some sort of authority going to have to direct it."
New MCI waiting Lot,jfinks,5902414,379356,I wonder if another aspect of the increase of drivers there is just the fact that there are facilities now and it isnt so far away from terminals.
New MCI waiting Lot,John McYeet,5903421,379356,I was thinking that. Looks like the surge has finally calmed down a bit. It’s up to a $16 max surge though when I know through the winter it seemed to top out at $10.
New MCI waiting Lot,jfinks,5903766,379356,"Ya I was up there for a bit tonight. I headed that way since I was halfway there already after dropping off in NKC. Lyft queue was around 13. It took about 5 minutes to get to top of queue on lyft. 56-60 on uber would have been over an hour, but had a $16 bonus. Lyft had a $5.30 ride bonus. I opted to get out of there, had a bird in the hand. I didn't even have time to use the restroom...I almost headed up again after dropping someone off later in KCK. But uber was showing 75-80, which isn't totally accurate, could be quite a bit more."
New MCI waiting Lot,John McYeet,5904120,379356,"Yeah I checked in around 9pm with 65+ and it look less than an hour to get a ride. Plus it was surging at the time of ride so I got a little more than the posted $16 surge rate.I don’t know, I kind of like it. I haven’t waited much over an hour to get a ride even when there was 100+ cars on Wednesday it maybe took an hour and 10 minutes to get a ride. I know I need to not get used to it but it’s been nice so far. Made some decent money off just airport trips this week for sure.I had a thought that they should make it a multilevel garage kind of like what they have at the terminals. I know they’d never shovel out the money for it but it’s nice to think about a garage type of waiting space."
New MCI waiting Lot,jfinks,5904799,379356,"There is more room to the north to expand the lot if needed. My idea has always been to monetize the waiting lots to pay for maintenance and upgrades. Have a convenience store, car wash, maybe even basic maintenance center like rotate/balance tires, oil changes, inspections, etc."
New MCI waiting Lot,John McYeet,5905640,379356,They honestly should move the green light hubs to the airport. I guess it’d be kind of far for people to drive but I think it’d be a good location.
New MCI waiting Lot,GMdriver50,5906520,379356,Does rematch still work?
New MCI waiting Lot,kcdrvr15,5908826,5890420,"I accepted a lyft request to kci, term C, before I could clear the circle, request from term B, this was mid-morning on Thursday."
New MCI waiting Lot,jfinks,5921196,5890420,Had an Uber rematch around 4:30pm yesterday. Pretty much instant after ending trip. So it still is there. What is unknown of course is the ratio between pulling from the lot giving a rematch. Maybe they modify it depending on how many are waiting in queue and rider demand. Heading to the lot after a drop off isn't as big of deal now and will get better as the roads get done in and out of the terminals.
New MCI waiting Lot,jfinks,5931686,379356,Looks like the MCI lot surge party is over. That too care of the overflowing lot really quick.
New MCI waiting Lot,John McYeet,5931750,5931686,Yeah it's overI think they updated the lot location out of the old spot. Haven't seen more than 50+ drivers in the lot all week.

New Lyft Driver in KC,kcdrvr15,5908867,380601,"Welcome to the forums, noticed your from the Kansas side, I will give you 1 free tip for a good location that's often ignored... Legands Shopping Mall area and Hollywood Casino. I get a lot of taxi calls out from that area, about half the rides are into town on Fridays and Saturday evenings, good opportunity to book cash return trips...sssh I didn't say that. There is a large tech employer in the area, lots of lux apartments and young working professionals that use uber/lyft when ever they head into the city like Westport, the Crossroads, or the Sprint Center."
New Lyft Driver in KC,jfinks,5908940,5908867,Bad thing about being in that area is usually get pulled into the KCK crapper of State Line and Parallel to the east.
New Lyft Driver in KC,ToddDrivingKCMetro,5911502,380601,"Thanks. I live out that way and started two of my days at Hollywood. And yes, I always get pulled north and east. I ended up in Liberty more than once. Not bad, a good run there and back both times.I have accepted every ride so far, even queued ones. My third day, I got two PPZs for $18+. Is that related or is the ""ignore requests more the 8 minutes out"" the common reccomendation?Thanks again for the info. I'll take whatever suggestions I can get."

Lyft Driver Reimbursement Rate Increase,,367276,0,
Lyft Driver Reimbursement Rate Increase,NGOwner,5662549,367276,"Just an FYI to those of us in the KC metro. Lyft has raised its driver reimbursement rates on both sides of the KC metro. This happened sometime this week. Last weekend the old rates were still in force. Don't you think that Lyft would have sent out some email of some kind, or an in app notification that we're being paid better now? Nope. I got nothing.MO Lyft pickups now recieve:$0.88 base plus $0.728/mi & $0.12/minKS Lyft pickups now receive:$0.80 base plus $1.008/mi & $0.08/minOld MO Lyft rates: $0.825 base plus $0.6825/mi & $0.1125/minOld KS Lyft rates: $0.75 base plus $0.945/mi & $0.075/minUber Metro Rates: $0.82 base plus $0.6825/mi & $0.1125/minLyft could easily get drivers to switch over to them if they made the KS rates metrowide. Right now I have no qualms canceling on an Uber rider when a Lyft ping comes through on the KS side (the differential is not high enough on the MO side). I'd have no qualms doing that metrowide if Lyft equalized to the higher reimbursement rate.Maybe its time for everyone to fire up Lyft on when we're on the KS side?[NG]Owner"
Lyft Driver Reimbursement Rate Increase,kcdrvr15,5664973,367276,"Tks for the info, I have not been doing very many lyft rides due to the low pay, but this is still way below where we started in 2015.. sigh"

However I've been getting constant CC Plaza/Westport pings from JCCC area, 20+ minutes away. This is mainly on Fri/Sat night when Uber is surging. The Lyft requests come in so fast I can't shut the app off... I end up having to just accept a trip and shuffle the rider just to get the lyft app to shut up.Here is an interesting thing I have noticed lately. As soon as I accept a Lyft ride (and I have been waiting for an Uber ping for a while) I get an instant Uber ride. Hmmmmm.Gotta give Lyft props for an increase though instead of any decrease."
Lyft Driver Reimbursement Rate Increase,kcdrvr15,5668296,367276,"The rate increase didn't do any good, yesterday, most of the day and well into the evening, till the planes stopped, 0 drivers in the que at KCI.What was really funny was watching our favorite airport police/traffic officer dealing with all the 2nd and 3rd lane pickups ( illegal, must load and unload at the curb) I picked up two taxi fares, they both wanted to know what happened to all the uber drivers ? LOLI advised them that my ""snow rates were in effect"" ie $3 mile, and they responded no problem. First ride from KCI to Weston Crown Center, $70 plus, second trip was $80.

Lyft Driver Reimbursement Rate Increase,ten25,5756271,367276,This appears to have been lowered again to old rates on Jan 6th...Don't get why Uber/Lyft think it's necessary to keep prices this low.

Never want to see their sorry asses again.Any ride greater than min, no tip. Four star. I'll give them another chance to make things right. If I see you again, and you don't tip, despite the hints I'll drop on the second ride, three star.Any ride + tip.

Then if they are really annoying in some way, goes to 1.Of course this is all secret, never mention the max they are getting is 3, lol...Like I said, on Uber it feels weird at first to consistently rate 3 stars because you are conditioned to rate the default 5.

There is a chance they won't find out, but it is unlikely. Welcome to the world on non-existent online privacy.If I was you, I would switch your insurance ASAP to a rideshare policy, with another company. If you stay with the current company and switch to rideshare, they could still cancel you for fraud. If you roll the dice again and stay with them, and they cancel you, your next policy will be very expensive.Consider yourself lucky.

"Lets play ""What would you do""....",jfinks,5486248,356637,"Cause I really didn't want to do it, but was kind of leaving it up to the rider to call. It was lyft and I can't call from my tablet so it is kind of a pita to initiate a call. I guess I figured if the rider really needed a ride that bad they would call. Or maybe it wouldn't matter cause they would say just going a couple miles and I wouldn't go anyway. Worst case they lie and say they are going to KC, then get there and trip is just a few miles.Really it was 15 miles further south than I already was. If that is a short trip in Spring hill at that hour it is over 30 dead miles for a $3 trip. If lyft or rider threw out an upfront $20 bonus or something then maybe.If it was uber then probably would have called, I can call through the app on tablet. Lyft is lacking in that dept, along with many other things. Lyft desperately needs a ""dark mode"". I use a 10"" tablet for this and their app is ridiculously bright, I actually turn the brightness on tablet almost all the way down and it is still too bright."

KCI Rematch?,gambler1621,5477773,356220,"What time period does the 10 trips cover? 1 day, 7 days? 3 weeks? I have received rematches before even reaching the airport recently. I am a lowly blue ball driver because I refuse to bend over for Uber.By the way, I love the new driver rewards. I am making more than ever using my old strategy. I will take cash in my bank account over the rewards."
KCI Rematch?,Ffruegle1,5478045,356220,"This has been happening for one week now. Midday trips to late afternoon. Last rematch I got was a week ago, late afternoon."
KCI Rematch?,bpsa1,5478702,356220,I didn't get one when I went to KCI after dropping off a pax from DT. It was terminal C if that matters. I live near the airport anyway so no rematch there doesn't bother me too much as opposed to drivers who live in JoCo or somewhere like that
KCI Rematch?,jfinks,5482286,356220,"I have noticed less rematch activity but the holding lot moves much faster lately. Wonder if only Diamonds have a chance at rematch now.There are 3 times when I wish I had my trip durations back,1. Stadium at high surge time, you want your first two trips to take you no further than down town or out east. Then the 3rd trip you want a long trip out of the area, like to OP or way up north, since your 3rd ride will probably be the end of the main part of surge.2. if I end up in lees summit or further south. You can get requests but it is good to make sure they are heading back north.3. Airport ride filtering, either to or from. If I'm on a destination to the airport it was good to see general direction and duration to pick the trip that got you to the destination. Uber seems to think downtown or plaza is close enough to getting you to destination from OP... If at the airport you could filter through a few rides to get one that is 30-40 min south.Other than that the Uber pro stuff isn't that big of deal."

KCI Rematch?,Ffruegle1,5483985,356220,"I haven’t had a rematch in over a dozen trips now. Uber said to reload my app. Tried that; naturally made no difference. Oh well, it was nice while it lasted."

KCI Rematch?,kcdrvr15,5484885,5484332,"Yea, if you move just a little bit around the circle, you will notice areas where it's not busy, pull over, with your flashers on, next to rental car bus stops, the popo will ignore you for at least 5 min, I use the time to fill out my ride book, check email or texts, and voice mail. Just don't sit there, starting straight ahead... uber drivers are easy to spot for the airpt pd."
KCI Rematch?,jfinks,5486023,5484332,"Ya definitely don't mess around when it is busy, but if the terminal or section is very quiet it is easy to just loiter about for a few min. But if I'm getting a rematch it generally happens pretty quickly. You can easily take a lap from B to C and C to B, just drive slow. After a lap of each leave or head to lot.I never thought about looking for my ant on the rider app. Interesting that it disappears if your rematch times out.This was a first for me last night. I waited in queue for about an hour and got to the top. The request said ""short trip we'll hold your place in line for 6 hours"". I accepted and took a rider to a hotel east of airport. Hopped back on I-29 and was back in queue and had another request in a couple of minutes."

Uber Pro: My observations in KC for the past 3 weeks,,353214,0,
Uber Pro: My observations in KC for the past 3 weeks,bpsa1,5422845,353214,"I just hit the Uber Pro Diamond threshold this past weekend. My acceptance rating is in the high 80's (88%), and cancel rating is around 2%. Sunday was my first full driving day with the status. Previously, I just had my acceptance rating go over the 85% threshold prior to Labor Day weekend, so that I could unlock the Diamond benefits that I earned prior. Here are my observations thus far:Priority Airport Rematch. I took 3 rides to the airport. Each time I got rematched (within seconds), the ride information on pop-up shows ""Priority Ride"". One of the rematched rides had 4 large bags, a stroller, and a ~1-2 year old without a car seat, which I cancelled, and then left the airport empty-handed (come on, I'm an UberX). I don't know the inner workings of it, but I almost usually get rematch within a few seconds to a couple of minutes, previously. So not sure if there is any real difference in it. Of course there were many times I left KCI empty-handed. I don't really know if priority rematch will help with that or not.The Ride Direction/Length of Ride is my biggest benefit out of this (this is for gold and up). I've usually declined ride requests previously in areas I don't generally pick up from (ex-urbs, high crime areas). Having this information allows to me to predict where the ride will go, before I accept (best ones are rides in Johnson County going north around 30-45 minutes, since they are 99% going to KCI). Also, with this information I've declined more rides, especially rides 10+ minutes away that are only going a few minutes so my acceptance rating has taken a modest decrease from 95%. This allows me to better filter rides than previously, just based on pick up area, so I have been more inclined to pick up rides in areas I had previously avoided. As a predominantly Northland/DT/Johnson County driver, any rides that'll get me out of what I call trap areas where most rides are intra-city (Lee's Summit, Blue Springs, Independence) are what I seek using that information. I've noticed my fares have been slightly better with the duration/direction benefit than before.Arizona State University tuition benefit. Yes, I'm doing it. I signed up for it. I'm not a stranger to online classes, so this is a no-brainer for me. I have filled out everything/sent in everything and waiting on Uber to pay the $70 application fee. They basically cover what you would be responsible for out-of-pocket, after grants. They don't cover books. I have an associate's degree and been wanting to finish my Bachelor's for awhile now, so why not? I have 3,175 rides under my belt, above the 3,000 required. Just to keep this benefit, it would only require KC drivers to have the 3,000 rides, and just do 67 rides during 3 point periods, every 3 months. Not really hard to do maintain it once you reach the threshold.5% cash back on gas. Use it at Costco or Sam's. Makes their gas about 10-11 cents cheaper a gallon."
Uber Pro: My observations in KC for the past 3 weeks,jfinks,5423540,353214,"I have been gold quite a while but just went over the 85% acc rate last week and hit platinum yesterday. I had been working on getting acceptance rate up there for the last month so I could try it out and see if it is worth it. I am right at the 85% level so I have to be careful and not decline too many rides. One thing that is important is to accept all stacked trips, I got burnt by this while on a trip and ignored a few stacked trips. It bumped me below the 85% for a while. I guess just have to accept them and then hope they cancel or cancel the trip if it is too far once you drop off. I am using the ""stop new requests"" feature more to prevent stacked trips. I am going to work to get around 90% acc rate so I can be a little more selective and not risk dropping below 85%.It was funny yesterday early before the game. Lyft was going crazy and I couldn't shut it off, it kept giving me a new request before I could toggle it off. It was all trash anyway, all lyft requests were over 15minutes away.I drove longer than I ever have recently yesterday and did pretty good. Ended up at about $350 in about 12 hours. This wasn't constant driving, took a couple breaks, shopped at MicroCenter for an hour or so, waited 40 minutes in the hold lot at airport. But it was about 12 hours away from home. No trips for the game crowd at the stadium but was out east on Noland road around 9pm and had a late pickup in front of Arrowhead. I had to do a little ""offroading"" to get there since all the roads were closed. I just jumped the curbs when needed making my way to the stadium. lol Took some Ravens sports reporters to a hotel near the airport.End of week logged about 28 hours and made about $720 or so. Not too bad."
Uber Pro: My observations in KC for the past 3 weeks,gambler1621,5432752,353214,"i started at about 30% acceptance and 2% cancellation. Trying hard to increase/decrease those stats without taking obviously bad trips and cancelling obviously bad trips after acceptance, I increased acceptance to about 68%, cancellation inreased to 12%, but income per hour increased. I have notices no difference at the airport.In conclusion, it's not worth it to me to reach the thresholds (I have more than enough rides to maintain gold). I also noticed my driver rating dropped and my personal satisfaction tanked."
Uber Pro: My observations in KC for the past 3 weeks,jfinks,5432907,353214,"Ya, the trip direction and duration is ok, but if you are right at 85% it is easy to lose it. Iv'e had it for a while and lost it a couple times and can't say if it makes much difference. My limits to pickup time/distance is more important."
Uber Pro: My observations in KC for the past 3 weeks,jfinks,5482263,0,"Ya I had the full uber pro with estimated trip duration. I lost it last week when I ignored a bunch of requests while already on a trip with uber. I've been having to hit the ""stop new requests"" when on a trip to shut them off and that is kind of a pain and easy to forget. Usually do it on longer trips only though. Generally I don't like stacked rides because I have caught uber giving me requests in a surge and not paying surge rates.I'm back down to 77% and I calculated that I would have to accept 100 straight trips to get back up to 85% and that isn't going to happen any time soon."

Chiefs Sunday Night.,jfinks,5467371,355657,"What a crazy night. I dropped off a couple groups before the game. Decided to stay in the area. About 1/4 into the game had a lyft request for in front of the stadiums. I have a suspicion it was a KCTG driver just being a tool... I called on the way and tried to tell him to go to the visitors bureau, he said couldn't hear yada yada, I think he heard the FU at the end. I didn't cancel and the trip was still running at noon today, lol. Good thing lyft is a ""side chick""....Moron POlice directed by our criminal mayor was shewing drivers out of the lot about 3rd quarter. So I went to my private staging area out east. End of game waited for a good surge and popped a $21 surge going down town. Got another $21 request on way to down town so dropped off and headed back, I was thinking they would cancel, but nope, waiting in Drury inn lot. Wow there were a lot of people there, my riders said everyone was looking for rides but uber app was saying no cars available.Got another request out on Hwy 40, the guy was at the stadiums but had friends take him out east trying to get a ride. Smart guy, he was going to OP so nice surge ride almost all the way home.I'm not big on stadium work but this didn't turn out too bad. Key is to stage out east a couple miles from stadium, wait for surge, go online and take your pick.Looks like there is plenty of demand for at least 3-4 rounds as long as you don't get too far away from Stadium."

But the thing messes up on rides that have multiple stops. Yesterday I had a ride in Parkville that said west 22 minutes so I thought it was going to Leavenworth or something.

Anyone in the Kansas City area want a lyft amp? $20?,John McYeet,5193960,340037,Lyft sent me a new one because the one I currently have SOMETIMES makes a very tiny high pitched squeak when charging.

I was like Reeeeallllly, as he ran off. The trip was for about a mile so I said F that and canceled for rider behavior. Got a nice $8 cancel fee and took off for home. Looked it up and rider was charged about $13. lolNext ride was in South OP, around JCCC. It was after 3 am at this point. I pulled up to the house and waited 5 minutes, then rider called.

Uber's upfront trip information can be misleading,,344975,0,
Uber's upfront trip information can be misleading,tmart,5272592,344975,I accepted a 10 mile pick up request in Gardner from Olathe today. I found out 9 minutes south meant 3/4 mile away and not a single stoplight. At a $3.63 fare - the premium pickup isn't worth it. I feel deceived because every other 9 minutes trip is normally 3 miles w lights included. My guess is after multiple people reject a request - they change the metrics (so someone thinks it's halfway decent and accept it) !!!

The third part is of course ride filtering due to too long of pickup or bad ratings. If a rider is less than like 4.8, then someone else can give them a ride. lol Especially at night in bar areas."

Newbie - Lyft Driver Assignments,jfinks,5149196,336736,Ya same here via k10. I am over by JCCC so can be on 10 in less than 10 minutes. Airport trips can be good as long as you can get a rematch and get out of their quickly.

The lyft graph is for Lawrence, but I guess it translates to the KS side of KC since that is part of the Lawrence market.

I just run both apps and ignore requests or turn the other app off on long trips.Mystro was decent a year or 2 ago when there was good amounts of surge in kc, but now just for an app switcher it isn't worth it.

Airport parking,Alkaiser726,5211054,338713,"Can confirm, it's $7.50 if you're even a second over the time limit. You can cycle your ticket and make it back to the lot within the 5 minute allowance, easy, but as said, waiting in the queue at all is generally a losing proposition unless you luck into some good timing (6-10 drivers with several planes landing in the next 15 minutes.)"
Airport parking,jfinks,5214145,5211054,"It must have changed recently, cause I was 10min over or so and it was a buck or so. I was right at the top of the queue and just waited.

Uber customer service rep hung up on me.,tmart,5231250,342418,"I called Uber customer service last night and askd them what to do if a customer requests for me to cancel a trip after 2 minutes (just happened). I stated that if I honor their request I will not receive a fee for my time, and my cancellation rate will also be affected in a negative way. The customer asked me several times to cancel, but then change their mind and said they were holding up the red light. I believe the customer did this so that they can tell Uber I never showed up and get out of the cancellation fee, clever huh. Uber needs to restore the cancellation reason, Rider cancelled trip, I have no idea why they removed it. I was calm cool and Collective during the call but kept asking the agent what was the best course of action and they became flustered because they had no answer and just dropped the call. Anyways what do you guys do if this happens if a customer keeps texting you over and over to cancel it, what do you do???? Thx"

The game has changed,John McYeet,5235680,341109,I always check the surge prices when the bars let out downtown and saw the past two weekends they got up to $10. Before then I think the highest I saw them was $5. Also the providence amphitheater works out really well. Worked the rob zombie and marlin Manson concert not to long ago and was pretty easy to pick up pax after the show. I think the only time it’s worth it is after events or big surge airport rides. Driving with no surge attached is pretty much loosing money at least driving the X option is that way.

Is driving part-time worth it?,tmart,5200422,340431,"Hello. Not trying to be negative, but the money was much better 6 months ago and prior . The compensarion rates are tough now, you will spend 9 dollars in fuel for every two hours you drive on avg, + rideshare insurance (most have a small premium increase) + frequent car washes and vacuumes, some days you will make 15 an hour and other days you may make 18 to 20 an hour/avg. However minus fuel, car payment, ins, cleaning, and more frequent wear and tear and car depreciation, currently it comes out to about $10 an hour. I would only recommend if you're in a tight squeeze for some cash, in between jobs, or just want to do it for the occasional make a quick 50 bucks get in and get out, not worth the risk of accident w frequent driving which will cost you a fortune and a possible huge spike in insurance rates if something happens (injuries), and car depreciation. Also... the miles stack up quickly - when you want to trade in your car in a few yrs you may not get nearly anything for it.Also in Kansas City I'm assuming that there are very few XL requests, and most of your trips will just be uberX"
Is driving part-time worth it?,jfinks,5200926,5200422,"One of the worst things about ""part time"" is going out for 2-3 hours and end up clear across town. The later it gets the less chance of a destination trip closer to home. This depends on where you live, if live more central KC it isn't as bad.I don't think including a car payment in calculating the hourly rate is correct. Most of the insurance you would have anyway so including that isn't needed either. I can go out almost at anytime, any day, and make quick 50, but like you said, if you need 50, you need 60 including gas for that time. My operating gas cost is about $3 per hour and I get about 20mpg."

If you're downtown and you have your DF on, you'll get the airport run over those who don't.And DF also seem to override the ""hourly rate equilization algorithm"" Uber uses. Case in point: Had three airport runs yesterday. First was dumb luck, the next two with DFs. Hourly revenue rate almost hit $35.

Force lyft to surge airport.,John McYeet,5093145,333811,So I guess I should say I’ve only been doing this for several months to begin with so I’m not quite a veteran yet.BUTTTT......I always see the airport surging for Uber. Weather it’s $1.75 or $14. Lyft hardly ever surges there but yet the queue almost always has someone in it.When the queue for lyft goes all the way to 0 and lyft DOES start to surge why don’t people not get into the airport queue anymore? Won’t that force lyft to keep the airport surging?I know everyone won’t see this post but doesn’t that make sense to try and keep the airport surging so we can all try and get surge/prime time rides? Maybe it’s a stupid suggestion but whenever I see the airport at 0 lyft cars I keep my app off until it starts to prime time.

A theoretical earnings potential in KC,gambler1621,4994460,327329,"I posted this in another thread, but thought it deserved a thread of it's own. What are your thoughts?Using Uber's current rates, a driver working 100 hrs per week, with a passenger in the car moving at 30 mph, 50% of the time, doing 200 trips per week can only make about $1230 per week plus what they get for wait time, long distance pickup, surges, and tips. Wait time and long distance pickups pay very little, and surges have been slashed to fraction of what they used to be. Tips are the big variable. If you end up with 20% in tips that would be less than $1500 per week. Of course you will put 1500 miles on your car and have the corresponding expenses for that (maintenance, gas, tires, oil, depreciation, insurance, etc).So, I guess it is ""possible"". If you have perfect strategy & tactics, a cheap to operate vehicle, and are willing to kill yourself in the process. Of course it is also very risky. Accidents, deactivations, illness, family emergencies, and vacations, will quickly deflate your earnings potential.If you are driving XL or Select, then it becomes more likely, but still doubtful that you can reach the $100k milestone.If you work a measly 50 hrs per week, you could earn $750 per week + tips, surge, long pickup fees, & wait time. You would put about 750 miles on your car. Your taxable income would be about $315 per week or $15750 yearly assuming 50 full work weeks. This equates to $6.30 per hour taxable income. Minimum wage is $7.25 in Kansas right now.Of course, your results will vary. I could plug in hundreds of different variables to come up with different answers. The bottom line is you have to spend the time to figure out what works for you, then maximize your efficiency to make the most you can. But, if you expect to make $100k before expenses, it is virtually impossible."

A theoretical earnings potential in KC,wallyruss5813,5027794,5010021,"The Kansas City market is ideal for uber because it encompasses a 40 mile radius around KC. You can literally run 11 to 20 mile long trips all day and night. as far as getting a mini van I am 100% for you to do it. The 40% XL you get in trips means a 25% raise in rate for XL trips. I kept track of those numbers and they were steady the 2 years I drove. The best days to drive are St. Patricks Day and Cinco De Mayo. Some people like New Years Eve but I found that between 10:30 and 1:00 am it was dead. As far as your assertions let me address each one.1. Uber XL will get you 40% of your total rides as XL2. I never counted on surge and it was a minuscule compared to my earnings3. Tips accounted for 10% of my earnings4. UBER's take is 26% of total earnings not 40% to 60%I would still be driving but I had 2 minor fender benders a year ago and 6 months later uber ran an annual background check and terminated my contract. My driving record will clear up in 22 months and I intend to go back. I am currntly retired with a 36K disability and in 19 months my disability converts to retirement which will give me 74,000 a year. With Uber I could be making over 120K a year working part time.

You can expect your insurance company to fight you tooth and nail to NOT pay for anything unless you have a rideshare endorsement on your personal policy or you carry a commercial policy. If you want guaranteed coverage, your best option is to have a commercial policy (Geico, for example), or have a rideshare endorsement added to your personal policy. If your company does not offer either one, you are rolling the dice unless you have something in writing from your agent telling you that you are covered for anything that Uber/Lyft does not cover."
Rideshare endorsement a must for uber/lyft drivers on your insurance policy!,NGOwner,4954570,305798,"Some definitions:Period 0: App is off. Your personal policy covers you.Period 1: App is on, you're waiting for ride request. A personal policy without ridesharing coverage doesn't cover you. Uber and Lyft insurance limited to liability coverage.Period 2: Request accepted, and you're en route to pick up a passenger. Uber's or Lyft's insurance policy is in full force.Period 3: You have passengers in the car. Uber's or Lyft's policy is in full force.There are four things at play here.1) With a Rideshare rider, you have affirmatively informed your insurance company that you are, at times, using the vehicle for commercial/rideshare purposes. There is no wiggle room there for the insurance company to try to weasel their way out of covering you for an accident. Very important in times of really bad/expensive accidents that are your fault in Periods 0 or 1.2) The insurance coverages in Period 1 are laughable, and aligned to the state minimums. And without a rideshare rider, your collision and comprehensive coverages on your personal insurance are likely void. Meaning, you cause an accident enroute to a pickup, NOBODY reimburses you for your damaged car, and payments for the damage you caused are limited to the (ridiculously low) state minimums ($50,000 maximum limit per person, $100,000 maximum limit per accident, and a $25,000 maximum limit for property damage). With rideshare, your collision and comprehensive applies, and your own (presumably higher) liability limits are still in force.3) If you have comprehensive and collision coverages, Uber's and Lyft's coverages during Periods 2 and 3 are CONTINGENT on your insurance company knowing about this side gig. In the event you cause an accident, the worst case scenario is either,a) your insurer will agree to Uber/Lyft covering your claim, then drop you for fraud (good luck getting another reasonably priced policy from any insurer), orb) they will tell U/L that you are not covered due to rideshare usage, U/L will then deny your claim, and your insurer will drop you for fraud.4) If your deductibles are less than the $1000 for Uber or the $2500 for Lyft (and whose aren't?), your rideshare rider makes up the difference so you are only out your own policy's deductible, not the deductible of U/L.Having a rideshare rider through Allstate is a no brainer for me as it only costs about an extra $20 per year.Sources:https://www.allstate.com/auto-insurance/ride-for-hire.aspxhttps://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/insurance/best-ridesharing-insurance/https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013080548-Insurance-Policy#offline[NG]Owner"

If you end up with 20% in tips that would be less than $1500 per week. Of course you will put 1500 miles on your car and have the corresponding expenses for that (maintenance, gas, tires, oil, depreciation, insurance, etc).So, I guess it is ""possible"".

I also use Mystro to minimize ""distracted"" driving issues, and filter out ""bad"" Pax situations. 4.50 is the lowest I'll go, and I'm probably cutting out many more rides by doing that; I may have to alter that a bit and see what happens. anyway, the last two months of driving in the evenings I've had 1 lyft drive, and 87 Uber. now, i do have Uber as my primary app on Mystro, but Lyft kicks on after two minutes (per my filters). Is lyft just that slow, or maybe I'm not driving at the right times? I'll get stacked trips on Uber, which of course keep Lyft turned off, managed by Mystro. I knew when I signed up that Uber was much more popular than Lyft, but not by this much. any ideas?"

Morning and evening rushes.And remember, on the Kansas side, Lyft pays ~40% more than Uber on a mileage basis. So I'll give Lyft a longer pickup radius in Kansas, and I'll even cancel an existing Uber regular ping to reroute to a regular Lyft ping if:1) The pickup is in Kansas, and2) The pickup is no more than one additional mile further than the Uber ping.It's all about the benjis, baby![NG]Owner"

Kansas City Uber Newb,Johnriii,4878440,319140,"relatively new to the Uber thing, (6 months) but I don't rely on this money to pay my bills. you're literally playing Russian roulette with your car if you're relying on it to help pay your bills. my car is 2015, and I take meticulous care of it, but i did that before I did Uber. mechanically, it's pristine, but a lot of used cars come with other folks hidden problems. I got extremely lucky when I bought mine (used) two years ago. not telling you how to make your cash, but Uber/Lyft is an unmerciful grind, and most folks who step into the pool jump out pretty quickly when they realize the outside costs that it takes. also, use YouTube to research for at least two weeks, there is a crap ton free info out there that you may want to hear/see before you dive in. good luck, bro."

Did I get ripped off?,,318252,0,
Did I get ripped off?,JoeJohn,4856306,318252,I'm pretty sure Uber ripped me off on this trip from the airport. I send in a message asking them to review and they basically told me that it averages out over time and don't worry about it. That 15$ surge should have been stretched in my favor to reflect the 42 mile trip. Would like to hear what some of you have to say about it.
Did I get ripped off?,gambler1621,4858965,318252,I have only received 1 surge in the last year for an airport trip.
Did I get ripped off?,JoeJohn,4860388,318252,Should have mentioned pax paid 95$
Did I get ripped off?,tmart,4861912,318252,"Isnt the surge flat no matter what, or am I missing something"
Did I get ripped off?,JoeJohn,4862450,4861912,Uber is supposed to stretch the flat surge based on time and distance so that drivers get a more meaningful portion of the pax payment. I had a ride at 5.50 surge for 15 miles that got stretched to over 20$ in surge money before. The basic question here is why do they pick and choose when they decide to stretch our surge money and should they be taking almost 50% of your best fare of the week and justifying it by telling you don't worry it all works out in time. Just seems wrong to me.
Did I get ripped off?,TXqwi3812,4862501,318252,Surge has nothing but grey areas. That is the way Uber likes it. Keep the drivers as confused as possible and throw them a bone on rare occasions.What is really sad is what you would have made without the surge.Also of course no tip from the cheapo paxhole.
Did I get ripped off?,tmart,4865502,318252,Yes maybe a Federal Regulation needs to be passed where there can be no ambiguous compensation rules but everything must be made clear

Flat surge,Chrisw1996,4787428,313801,Let's talk flat rate surge!The top 3 pictures are during surges either on fridays or Saturdays from 11pm-3amAs you can see i had trips <15min or less few mile trip and made $25+ which made the miles on my car and being up at 11pm-3am worth it. Not to mention the multiple shootings and robberies on uber drivers in Kansas city within the last 4 months.Now with flat rate surge take pic 1 as an exampleI would've made roughly $10 instead of $27!!!Pic 2 I would've made $15 instead of $63!!!!!Pic 3 I would've made roughly $13 instead of $33Yet keep in mind uber is making the same amount of $$$ per trip!Pic 4 are some of the highest surge prices I've seen on flat rate and its day after a snow storm.And dont even let get me started on how many times I've got close to a surge area and it disappears!What's your thoughts?
Flat surge,ScubaSteve2177,4790300,313801,The highest flat surge I've seen is $18.. so $5 is def not the highest.

MCI queue is a joke at 2pm Sunday,jfinks,4025674,265630,"Wow what a joke the queue is now. I recently started with lyft and got my first airport ride from OP on Sunday about 2pm. I'm not sure if lyft has a rematch or not. It was a decent paying ride but no rematch after cruising the terminals a couple times, so I headed to the lot. 24 in queue for Lyft and 36ish for Uber. Not too bad. I gave it an hour and Lyft was down to 17 and uber down to 29. I took off after that. At that rate it was going to be 4 hours I think."
MCI queue is a joke at 2pm Sunday,Mighty Mo,4025935,265630,"Can't say I'm real familiar with the process your talking about. One weekend after a long Friday night, about 4:00am I picked up a nice older lady at a kind of well to do hotel, who was going to the airport off 29. Boy was that a story...The ride went fine, until the airport, when I ended up on the outer ""service"" roads around the terminals, and was pulled over for turning right on a no right on red stop(It was dark I didn't see the sign).And I couldn't make this up if I tried, I had already gotten a speeding ticket that night in Parkville. Thankfully the guy at airport left me off with a warning, and I was able to get PAX to her destination. I even offered to no cost her, but she said she understood and was very much okay with the situation and understood it was an honest mistake.All this, just to say I have noticed on the uber map a ""Black circle P"", and after my trip to KCI figured it was something to do with airport rides maybe. But do not know how to use it exactly. I really wish I could set it as a destination to drive to."
MCI queue is a joke at 2pm Sunday,jfinks,4026328,265630,"I have no idea how you got on the outer service roads, didn't know you could even. On 29 going north there are 2 right lanes that go up and over the highway and straight up into the terminals.The P is at Economy lot C. I don't think you can put a destination to it. Just follow the signs that say economy parking. It is a ways away from the terminals."

Rematch is awesome (when it works).Never ever ever get in the queue at the airport. I don't care if the number of cars is single digits. Never ever ever.You're better off burning 20 deadmiles to get back to the city to a ping than waiting the 3 hours at the airport.And good Lord, if one gets screwed up finding the terminals at KCI, maybe one ought to be looking for a different side gig.[NG]Owner"

MCI queue is a joke at 2pm Sunday,jfinks,4030214,265630,"Since the uber rematch system I have always gotten a rematch as long as it was mid day when it is busy and flights are coming in. The last 2 airport trips for uber was at 4am or so. No reason to wait around after that. The queue used to work ok but you had to sometimes wait 1-2 hours, but not always."
MCI queue is a joke at 2pm Sunday,kcdrvr15,4031978,265630,"I get several lyft premiums to kci every week, never got a rematch with lyft. Lyft puts every one in same que, ie lyft, lyft extra, and lyft premium, usually takes over an hour or two to get a premium ride, so hanging at the airport is a waste of time. If your from Johnson county or the west side of the kc area, leaving kci, use the 435 route, you may snag a rider from Leavenworth, Lansing and the Piper area. Several times during the mid morning, after dropping at KCI, I will stop around 12oth st exit, off hiway, and get out to take a short break and stretch my legs, have gotten requests from these areas, good rides too, usually going to KCI, Greyhound Bus station and Union station. Several riders have told me they tried several times to get a driver, but no one would take the ping. They then requested premium because the app showed me closer than anyone else. Even got a good tip.My suggestion is directed at the drivers of multi class vehicles, if your leaving the airport empty, try the 435 route, change your app to extra or select only, don't try and snag one of the riders as a x or base fare, they will request what is available, so don't be available as an uber-x or base lyft."

MCI queue is a joke at 2pm Sunday,jfinks,4115111,4114863,"It depends on the time of day and if any planes (potential riders) are coming in.

I headed to terminals and ended up circling for 30 minutes.In frustration I decided to go back to the lot to pickup an Uber ping. I then received a Lyft ping so headed to pick it up. That was my 2nd mistake. It was a short ride to Lake Wakomis.Does Lyft have short ride priority if you return to the airport? Will you still get a ping if you don't head to terminals when prompted?"

I got the notification to head to terminals after about 10 minutes waiting, it went pretty fast, but I didn't have a request yet. On Mexico Blvd I got a request but not at the terminals, it was at the UPS site. I figured it was fine, just an employee or pilot heading home somewhere. Nope, for some reason a ""friend"" drove my rider up to the airport and they ordered a lyft to finish the trip to the terminals. I have no idea why she couldn't have just dropped her off at the terminal... I was internally like WTF, but figured gotta get this done and get back into queue. Of course when I get to the queue again lyft is at 17 now. 1 starred that rider, then she tipped 2 bux. lolGot an uber ride to OP after waiting in queue for 15 min.

Most interesting conversation NYE 2019,gambler1621,4617618,302986,"What was the most interesting conversation that you had or heard between pax last night? I'll start off...Couple gets in the car and is headed about 15 min away. The wife talks about their friend who is pregnant and the parenting skills of the new parents. Then, after several minutes, the wife says ""we should start soon"". After the pregnant pause (pun intended), the husband starts coming up with reasons that they should wait (places they want to visit, events they need to go to, etc.) The wife doesn't let the conversation go, she keeps reiterating that they should start soon. I am sitting here wondering what happened when they got home...I was feeling a little devious. I was tempted to say ""You should start practicing tonight. After a couple of months of practice, see what happens"" I didn't of course, but it sure was tempting.A distant 2nd was the 19 year old threesome talking about dressing like druggies and using meth."

Headed home about 10:30. I wasn't feeling the uber thing at all last night and waiting for all the drunks after midnight wouldn't have helped.

SEVERAL times this week I've been right in the heart of a 3.something surge and getting zero requests! WTH? Anyone else experiencing this b.s.?
Anyone else get royally screwed out of surges this past week??,jfinks,4562186,299694,"Uber is dumb and lets the riders know in the app the surge level. So if a rider has time to wait they wait it out. The surge isn't only created by the amount of requests being made but also from the amount of device activity in the area. Uber can tell that 100s of potential riders are ""looking"" for a ride in a particular area, not all of them order a ride though, maybe 10 out of 100 actually order a ride while it is surging. Some switch to lyft app and request there. They are all consumers looking for the cheapest ride."
Anyone else get royally screwed out of surges this past week??,gambler1621,4571016,299694,I actually hit more surges on longer rides this week than I normally do. I am lucky to hit any surges at all most weeks. I guess I had a lucky streak. Of course I had a really bad day this week too. 2 1/2 HOURS with no pings in an area that usually pops. Maybe the Uber gods felt bad for me and gave a lot of surges the next 2 days.
Anyone else get royally screwed out of surges this past week??,jfinks,4571041,299694,"No it is just the season where a lot are out and about going to family and work parties. It's been good the last couple Friday and Saturday. Lyft pretty much sucks, but have give a few rides on it. Lyft is annoying once you get online, it will auto add to your queue without regards to how far away the next rider is. I had to cancel a Lyft pickup when I was sitting in a 3x uber surge. The lyft pickup was 10min away and very little prime time maybe 25%. The uber ride was just around the corner and a 3x surge. Even had a rider ask last night if I could stop at a QT and if I needed some gas... He filled my tank from about 2/3rds full. Nice tip."
running both lyft and uber apps at the same time,,285540,0,
running both lyft and uber apps at the same time,Johnriii,4331287,285540,"Just started on both, but i usually run one or the other, not both. I've seen videos and forum post where folks are successfully doing both, and i'd like some tips on how to make that happen. in a car not moving, I get it, not too difficult to do. accept a ride from one, flip over and turn the other one off. however, that's not going to be so easy at 50-60 mph on a crowded highway at rush hour. I've thought of use Mystro or Maxymo to help, but I worry about acceptance rates, especially on Lyft. from what I know, lyft is really tough on cancellations and turn downs, while Uber doesn't seem to care as much. again, I'm new at this and neither one of them may not care about acceptance rates, but i figured i'd hit up you guys who've been out there for a while."
running both lyft and uber apps at the same time,NGOwner,4334737,285540,"I've been doing both for a while. Have never used Mystro or Maxymo. Have done it manually since Lyft came back to town in November of '16.1) Neither Uber nor Lyft care about acceptance rates. Lyft will send passive-aggressive nastygrams after you've ignored/declined 25-30 pings. Ignore those nastygrams just like you'd ignore a 22 minute Lyft pickup. It makes no difference.2) Normally you're not travelling 50-60 miles an hour getting pings. Normally we're in the city dealing with city traffic. Wait for a stoplight, then switch over to the other platform and go offline, then switch back to navigation. Shouldn't take more than 5 seconds to accomplish. After a while, you'll get accustomed to it, and will only have to glance briefly at the phone switching apps and going offline and switching to navigation, even while driving.3) 25% of the time I just flat out forget to go offline on one or the other platform. Another 25% I intentionally leave one or the other platform online to see if I get a 45+ notification (airport run), or a Lyft run in KS (if enroute to an Uber pickup in MO near State Line). If one or the other comes in, cancel and switch. Follow the money! But keep in mind that Lyft will cancel (they say the rider did, but we all know that Lyft did it for some reason or another) about 10% - 20% of the rides. So bird in the hand ....4) Every once in a while you'll get virtually simultaneous pings. Those can be hard. You just have to know your phone and know how to switch quickly to see which ping is ""better."" Or just make your life easy and take the one that's on top. Then do 2) when you get a chance.In our market we have to run both. In July and August my revenues were 50/50 Uber/Lyft. September is shaking out to be heavily skewed back to Uber, though.Good luck out there![NG]Owner"
running both lyft and uber apps at the same time,DivineDriver,4460802,4334737,I am fairly new too. Are we able to know how long the trip is before accepting on Uber? I thought they didn't tell you until after the rider gets in and you hit start. Samewith Lyft.
running both lyft and uber apps at the same time,NGOwner,4462590,285540,"If a ride (on either Uber or Lyft) is 45+ minutes (which invariably leads to an airport run), it shows up on the ping window.All other rides we have to wait until we arrive at the pickup (Lyft) or start the ride (Uber) to see how long of a ride it will be.[NG]Owner"
running both lyft and uber apps at the same time,gambler1621,4464243,285540,"I use 2 phones. It doesn't cost much more for 2 lines and you can sometimes get BOGO's when buying the phones. I have found that the 2nd phone pays for itself. I leave both apps on until pax in car and ignore pings unless probable AP run. You have to be careful of cancellation rate though. The biggest payoff has been accepting rides on 1 service while finishing a ride on the other. The 2nd phone also serves as a backup. If something happens to 1 phone, switch to using 1 phone only.I used Mystro before getting 2 phones. It worked, but I like 2 phones better."
running both lyft and uber apps at the same time,jfinks,4464451,285540,"I have a phone and a tablet, but I run both uber and lyft on the tablet. It connects to internet through bluetooth on the phone. I agree, it is nice having the phone as a backup. With the tablet it isn't a problem to switch between services on the run. Sometimes I will flip lyft back on a few minutes before dropping off an uber. I tried Mystro for a year, it was ok, but not worth it unless there is lots of surge which is rare.

People tip more often than in LA but the rates are really low.Tonight I drove completing 18 trips for 83 bucks. Damm in LA would be double than that at least also promotions there helps a lot.Still Never got any promotions from Uber. Do they have promotions for drivers in Kansas?During the day morning is good when you get trips to the airport but it's been dead. I am doing 15 bucks a hours really low compare to 30 bucks in California.
How do you guys survive doing Uber in Kansas City?,jfinks,4442518,292413,Called having a real job also.... The per mile rates are a little higher in KC than LA. But LA might surge more and KC has very little in way of promotions.
How do you guys survive doing Uber in Kansas City?,gwbraa,4442683,292413,No way buddy in LA Uber is paying almost 1 dollar per mile and also the minimum per trip is 6 dollars not 2.84 like in KCAlso the time in LA is 30 cents not 12 like in KCI do have a real job but with the rates in KC it's not even worth doing Uber during the night

I am done with Uber. I will save my car and work towards a promotion in full time job.Many drivers that I talked complain on low wages as well.2.84 versus 6 minimum for driversMany times I got one call in 30 minutes to make 2.84 no way. That's cannot cover the repairs in my car
How do you guys survive doing Uber in Kansas City?,Mighty Mo,4445252,0,"Full time job, Uber just side hustle. Also, unless your hitting primetime Friday/Saturday night bar scene, small rides aint gonna do it.I float the rural cities and catch long trips between and through KC to the airport, long as I'm busy turning the wheels, make off well enough for something on the side.It's not breaking the bank, but pays my gas and groceries which is good enough considering my full time job keeps me pretty tied down and denies me those Fri/Sat nights.I agree a ton of drivers waters it down too. Coupled with zero promotions outside of deliveries really hard to earn if you a try hard on the wrong time/day. Gotta be smart and play the times right, know when you've got all your gonna get. Tuesdays are not a good day, but I can net over $100 before it's over pretty easily, and if you call it quits before you vested too much, it makes out for me.So to answer your question, how we survive with Uber in KC?

How do you guys survive doing Uber in Kansas City?,gwbraa,4462046,292413,My account is older is 0.72 per mile but still you cannot drive any time in Kansas. You have to find the best times so you can be busy
How do you guys survive doing Uber in Kansas City?,jfinks,4462232,292413,"Even at .68 or .72 a mile you can do ok as long as you limit dead miles to an absolute minimum. Problem is what usually happens for me is I go drive for 2-3 hours in the evenings a couple days a week and you end up clear across town. Then about 8 pm or so things just go dead and no requests at all hardley and if you get one it is 15 minutes away or something crazy like that. So at that point I pack it in and dead head home, some times I stop by a store on the way so it isn't all bad. So on paper it looks like I made 50c per mile for the night, but a lot of that is the long drive home to southwest KC area. The longer you drive in a night things can even out. I like to make 30-40 bucks when I go drive for 2-3 hours and I usually do. However after 3 hours that sometimes means a 30 minute drive home."

Criminal Element,gambler1621,4461700,285963,"It's more than rude. It can get you permanently deactivated when the next rider reports you for being under the influence. Or. if you get stopped by police, your car will get searched."
Criminal Element,jfinks,4462247,4461700,"All they will find on a search for me is some McDs fries that fell between the seats.A while back I had a guy ask if it was ok to smoke a cigarette, and I said no. He seemed disappointed but I pointed out that uber doesn't allow smoking in cars on trips. Heck most cars these days don't even have ash trays. Mine doesn't and it is about 10 years old.I don't mind vaping, if it isn't too strong of smell."

locate lost phone,gambler1621,4453473,293009,"There have recently been reports of drivers getting arrested because they didn't return a phone ""fast enough"". I would bet that there are drivers who ditch a found phone to prevent the possibility of getting arrested. Also, if the driver didn't find it soon after you departed, A later rider could of stole it. I hope neither of these happened to you.First report lost phone to your carrier. Then contact Uber through the website, phone, or green light hub. Most drivers will meet you at a reasonably convenient time and location to return the phone. If you expect them to drive more than 5-10 minutes to get to you, you need to compensate them for their time."

Coming from Pittsburgh.. earnings in KC?,tmart,4419903,288931,"Ya its best to have a p/t gig minimum in kc making at least 250-300 a week take home, that way your not totally screwed if your 4 year old car your still making payments on breaks down with a 2500.00 repair (if you dont have this amount of cash on hand) and your down for a month or two. Btw...It can be good some weeks but it can be tough some weeks too (like daaang im not going to be able to make rent this week on time ). The wise will have either a) money in savings a few g's for emergencies, b) a backup beater car you can at least get to a job with if your 'nice' uber ride breaks down and you dont have the dough to repair it yet) or c) A full time job + uber (best way to go imo), this way your in a positive cash cycle no matter what and should be able to ride things out if they arise.

I have a cheap unlimited waterway fastpass where i pay $25 a month and get unlimited washes, so I go into those every time before I head out...

Extra $142 off.Great thing about Costco is their install includes road hazard, you don't have to pay extra for it. After checking a few other ""discount"" places for the same tires Costco was $100 less, then on top of that the 70 off and basically free installs which is another $142. I think my total bill was 675 and after the discounts it went down to $533.Now I gotta have all my Pressure monitors replaced. arrgh."

It was insane, she was acting like she had been roofie'd.It was bout 20 minutes before the show ended. I got in the pickup line in Lot J and called her like I always do when i'm picking up somebody at a large event. She answered in tears ""I just want to go home, I don't feel good. Please get me home. Where are you!? i don't see you!"" my finger hovered over the cancel button as soon as I heard the ""I don't feel good"", but then she said ""all the drivers keep leaving me, Please don't leave me, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME! I just want to go home"" over and over and over, like, i couldn't get a word in for about 3 minutes of this... I realized that I probably wasn't the first driver she'd spoken to and the others had cancelled on her, and maybe I'm just a big softy, but i took pity on her. So i told her i wasn't going to leave her and told her to tell me where she was, She had to ask somebody else in the lot where she was because she was so far gone she couldn't even see the letters. So after being in line and on the phone with her for 14 minutes, I get into Lot J and start looking for her, I see this girl on the wrong side of the caution tape in the empty lot next to J, just stumbling around in the dark. I tell the attendent she was my passenger and asked if he'd lift the tape up so i could go over and get her, he abliged and i drove up to her. She climbed in and I told her i have barf bags if she needs them. She said, ""I'm not sick, I just don't feel good, please get me home, please please just get me home"" then she tosses her phone into the front passenger seat and curles up into a ball across all 3 back seats and passes out, still muttering ""i just wanna go home"" for about 5 or 6 minutes. It was a 2.3X surge and a 20min drive to her house (or what i hope was her house, but who knows if she even knew what she was doing when she put in the location). She slept the whole way and when we go to her neighborhood, of course it was impossible to see any of he house numbers. I pulled up Google Street View and found what the house looked like and pulled into the gravel hilly driveway. I tried to wake her up with a couple abrupt taps of the brake and saying her name loudly, but she was freaking out. Finally i shouted ""YOU'RE HOME, TIME TO WAKE UP"".She slowly sits up and says, ""Where am I? How did I get here? Who are you?""""I'm your Uber Driver, We're at your house"" I said the address to herShe says, ""THAT'S IT! THANK YOU THANK YOU""""Don't forget your phone"" I handed her phone to her.""Where's my phone, I can't see it"".I put her phone in her hand and she very slowly and clumisly opens the door and steps out.""Do you need any help?""""I can do it, i just wanna......""You know in Return of the Jedi, when the AT-ST's are on Endore and the Ewoks roll the logs under it and it steps on the logs and the knees start wobbling back and forth and then it falls over and explodes.... Ya... That was her... She goes down hard onto the sidewalk, phone skidding about 5 feet, and she just curles back into a ball, crying and sobbing.I jump out of the car, pick up her phone and walk back to her, ""Sakina, I'm going to help you up, give me your hands"". I reach out and grab both of her hands and help her back up and she falls into my arms, no weight on her legs at all. I put one her arms around my shoulders and start slowly walking her up the wet, grassy hill to her front porch. I could see there was a TV on in the front room so we headed up the 8 porch steps to the door. I'm literally carrying her her entire weight and she's just saying ""thank you thank you thank you, i just wanna go home""We get to the porch and she falls into the doorbell, A guy her age comes to the door with a look of total shock and bewilderment... like... this dude looked like he had no idea what was happening. I say ""uh... Is this the right place? I'm the Uber Driver""He says, ""ya, yes, this is right"" and reaches for her, she just falls past him and faceplants on the hardwood floor inside the house... Door closes and i go back about my night... of course, adrenaline surging through me to the point i'm shaking...Was definately the craziest ride of my Uber tenure... The best part... I have a 360 Dash camera and I have the entire ordeal on it. The next day I called Uber support and just documented with them What happened, kind of to cover my bases in case she was drugged and they decided to call the police.anyhoo..."

I totally understand its for safety and fully agree with it. The issue is they just submitted it and it can take up to 7-15 business days to be completed...... The thing is I wanted to be driving and making money for the next 7-15 business days..... anyone have any suggestions or have went through something similar?

My app with uber started on 8/31 and they are still waiting on the background check. There is nothing in my background. Based on my experience I wouldn't expect a speedy response.

There are a lot of flights leaving at 6 am though, but good luck getting a rematch, and expect to wait in the lot until about 8:30 AM."

I almost said F it, I'll do it, but then got to thinking she's not even going to have a container for gas and is going to need a ride to somewhere close and then go back to put fuel in car. Then I have to dead head all the way back to KC...Anyway, cancelled, and headed back to KC.What would you all have done?

Out of Fuel!!!,jfinks,4275297,281737,"I weighed a lot of options. It came down to distance and the pain in the ass factor because of having to pick her up, find a container, get gas, and go back. She was almost in Lawrence, if she was closer to KC I might have, just dead miles have been eating me up lately. I wonder if I wasn't the first she contacted. I do appreciate her letting the driver know what is going on, but if she got more desperate maybe the other drivers didn't get that message.In hindsight thinking about this, if I decided to do it in the future I would probably stop at a gas station in on the way in Desoto and get some gas, a lot of stations will loan out a container if you leave something for collateral so you bring it back. It would have sped things up but I would want to start the trip in KC/Olathe and end where I started at least. But the rider could screw me out of the trip if she complained about distance."

I get a lot of rides back into KC, downtown, Sprint Center for concerts, etc. You just have to pick the right time to be out that way. Once I accepted I realized it was a little further away than I thought. That is why I canceled, she gave me a reason to due to the gas situation. Also I was really close to Hwy 10 via 7 after that drop off. Worst case I take it and someone is going to Lawrence, which isn't a bad place to be on a Friday night."

Lyft app issues after update,NGOwner,4279229,281426,"I've only had two issues with the Android version of the Lyft Driver app.1) (Lyft solved this issue on a later update). The app would not come back online after turning the slider offline after having been online for a while. I'd only know because I'd get a text message a while later saying I'd lost contact with the Lyft servers. I'd have to force close and restart. Then I would be online again. So my workaround was to always force close Lyft Driver before coming back online. Used KillApps to automate the force close. I still use KillApps to close UberDriver and Lyft Driver at the end of the shift. Those programs are persistent and who knows what info they siphon off and upload. Rather have them good and closed when I'm not using them.2) The app would have the spinny circle after accepting a ping. Couldn't get into navigation to pick up the customer. Solved that by swiping the program away from the recently opened app listing and then restarting the Lyft Driver.

This happened three more times and I realized she must've been by/with a partular Uber driver she was trying to match with. I decided to show some pity and declined the next request from her. Then I started receiving them again. I kept on receiving them and she kept cancling them until I finally received a request from someone across the street.I had fun messing with you and her. I promise I won't show pity next time and decline any. I prefer to keep my acceptance rate high and, most days, it works out very well for me."
Oak Park Mall,gambler1621,4255130,280553,"About what time was this? Sounds like she was probably trying to get another Uber Driver's acceptance rate up. I heard a rumor that when your acceptance rate is over 80%, you can get additional info before accepting pings. I should head there to see if she will help me."
Oak Park Mall,JoeBuckYourself,4255576,280553,"It has happened to me before, until finally they didn't cancel. When I picked him up he said he was trying to get an uber drive he was with, but it wouldn't go through to him. I believe it won't go to a driver who is right next to a requester."
Oak Park Mall,jfinks,4255972,280553,"I had this a month or so on lyft in Grandview. I'd accept and she canceled. This happened 2 more times, then nothing. About 5 minutes later I accepted and she didn't cancel. I waited a couple minutes and canceled then left. Had another request from same girl. I ignored. Hope she was late to wherever she was going.Then got another ride from Grandview to Lee's summit."

I know it's probably unrelated, but weird"

If you have a drop off and are within the terminal and a request comes through as you are currently there, it’ll ping you? If that’s the case, sucks for the others in the queue...maybe I have it wrong...Thoughts???"
New at KCI - ReMatch?,jfinks,3396696,226950,"It ""should"" make the queue smaller and wait times shorter for riders. Less drivers will have to trek all the way back to the lot since they will just pickup a new rider. In a perfect system at peak arrival times all drivers dropping off at the airport will be rematched to a rider leaving.So hmm thinking about this, how long can you linger around the circles hoping for a rematch?The other issue I see is that ""seasoned"" mci riders might be used to waiting over 10 minutes for a ride so they might order the ride before their luggage has arrived from the plane. So if they do this a driver might be waiting too long in the circle and security might shoo them away."
New at KCI - ReMatch?,JT21491,3396708,226950,The way I'm taking it is: If you drop off at the airport and you don't get a ping in 5-10 minutes you may as well head out. There's always going to be people dropping off who will get the ride request. You're going to see the number of people waiting in the queue drop drastically. People getting off a plane aren't going to wait 30-45 minutes for an Uber.This move should be real good for Lyft and their drivers.

Uber doesn’t care if you are waiting 2 hours in a queue in a parking lot that has not even a restroom.They don’t wanna the rider to wait 10 minutes for a pick up.They also don’t want us to get together and talk. They wanna avoid what happens at LAX for example where 99% of the drivers have some sense and they all simultaneously turn off the app so they can get a surge.Uber don’t give a about us.
New at KCI - ReMatch?,UberRazor,3404994,226950,I decided to test this out today without having a pax with me. I was up north and in the area of airport so I hopped in queue at 1:31pm at number 66 with Uber. It’s been 2.5 hours and I’m only at 19. I’m going out on a limb and saying the re-match is working it’s magic and thus slowing things down mightily if you choose to just hop in queue (or a request doesn’t come in while you’re at the terminal). I won’t be doing this again unless it’s a very late night and I’m up north already. I’ve never waited this long even if the wait queue has been around 80.

Drop him off and head toward the home pastures. 3/4 of the way there, I get a long pick up ping and since it was still early in the day went and picked up the pax and drove him to the airport terminal B, I check the Parking lot C queue and see it is 70+, I am like... nope, no way, not gonna happen... I pull out to the outer ring and ""PING!"" you have a pick up in 400 feet. Do some magnificent driving in that mess of terminal B today and drive the pax all they way down to Mission.Yesterday... Wednesday, I had pulled into the economy lot with out dropping off a pax at the airport because I dropped one off on Ambassador drive and wanted to check out the queue it was 66 when I got there, I chatted with some folks who said they had been there almost 2 hours. I sat for about 15 minutes to watch how quick the queue was moving and it was going slow. So I drove off and headed back to greener pastures.The airport changes are in effect. And in my opinion, they are working the way they really should be.Of course this is one of the busiest travel days of the year, but if the process works and when travel days are slow, you would then be seeing a small queue at Lot C.This change once it is fully understood will be a benefit for the PAX of course, but a side effect will make it great for the drivers as well. Also if Uber can get those 40 on average airport campers out on the streets they could then increase their foot print in KC and decrease the long pick ups that riders experience now."

Questions from first day driving????,,280231,0,
Questions from first day driving????,DivineDriver,4249212,280231,Hi all!I drove yesterday for 9.25 hours and had 11 trips and made $113.91. I was very surprised at how little people tip the drivers. I received 3 tips from the 11 rides. Is this typical?Also when multiple people get in the car does the rate stay the same?Very confused on surge area and how that works.I have the new app but don't see other drivers (little ants) on the map to see where not to go.Any help would be great!
Questions from first day driving????,Kodyhead,4249234,4249212,"Doesnt matter if there is 1 person or 47 midgets in your car it's the same rate.A combination of a new generation of non tippers, to uber in the beginning telling customers that tips are included and for a long time not allowing in app tips has house broken many riders to not tip. I think it's been a little over a year now that they allowed in app tips for riders but for most drivers more riders dont tip than do.Also they place many obstacles for tips to be missed as the longer the time after the ride ends, the less chance you have of getting a tip.You have to rate a driver to access the tipping screen. Half the riders dont rate drivers. Also most riders get out of the car and dontbl check their phones and probably delete the email receipt or not look at it which is another method of tippingImo the best would he to force drivers to get q signature at the end of the ride with a tipping screen like at a restaurant"
Questions from first day driving????,DivineDriver,4249368,4249234,You know I figured that was the case when Uber first started and didn't allow tipping in the app. Pretty sad if you ask me. Is there a way to get a signature at the end of the ride?
Questions from first day driving????,Kodyhead,4249407,4249368,"Absolutely not, that was just me daydreaming pf what I would do if I was in charge of uber. When I used to run restaurants I encouraged tipping (cowbells, gongs) as I can pay employees less lol, not sure why uber is against this as a little marketing will make drivers happier and not cost them anything."
Questions from first day driving????,thelungmeister,4249744,280231,"NEVER ever chase the surge. If you know where one might be, like the Cerner or Honeywell campus's between 3:30 and 4:30, that's good, just head where you think one will be... but if you see a surge and it's more than a 15min drive... don't waste the gas.I use the Uber Rider app to see how many drivers are in the area.According to the app, 72% of my riders rate me. I understand that's an anomaly.When it comes to tipping. People heading out to drink/party tip about 5-10% of the time. People who leave early from drinking/partying tip about 60% of the time. People leaving at the end of the party tip about 25% of the time. Couples age 18-29 heading out for date night tip about 15% of the time. Couples age 30-40 heading out for date night tip about 50% of the time. Couples 40+, it's a crapshoot. Married couples in those age ranges tend to tip less, but i totally get that. Corporate business men and women NEVER tip. Waiters and Waitresses tip about 99% of the time... Just like when you wait tables, you start to notice specific demographics who tip more or less. It's pretty funny. Also. if somebody says, ""Oh, i'll make sure to give you a big tip in the app"" this means they will neither rate, nor tip you at all.these are just my experiences."
Questions from first day driving????,jfinks,4250955,280231,Not really much surge out there to chase anymore. Now with the flat rate surge I'm gonna be declining lots more rides.

Newbie question,DivineDriver,4240991,279663,"I am brand new to Uber even though I signed up initially back in 2016. I am all ready to go. My question is if I am online with Uber, is it okay to ignore and not accept pings for now? Right now I am just wanting to see what ride requests come in, the time it does and then the typical distance of the requests."
Newbie question,thelungmeister,4241869,279663,"Technically, it does not hurt you... BUT, right now Uber is doing this thing where it will tell you the time and direction the rider is going when you get the ping. It's nice because if i'm wanting to stay near a specific location and I get a ping for a ride that is 18min east or something I can turn it down because the concert gets out in 20 minutes and i don't want to be 20 minutes away from a potential surge... if that makes sense... but if you get below 80% acceptance, you loose the ability to see that time and distance til you get back above 80%"
Newbie question,DivineDriver,4249043,279663,"thank you for the heads up. When I first started my app on Uber, I couldn't get out and drive but wanted to see how many times it pinged.

Arrowhead,kcdrvr15,4202719,4202704,"It is. Not worth the time and effort to drive all the way to the stadium, waste a couple of hours for what, $25 from lyft for a $80 ride.When clients call me to book stadium trips, I decline them, refer them to z-Trip."
Arrowhead,jfinks,4205200,276894,Picking up at the Welcome center is a blessing in disguise. It is so much easier to get out of there once you get your riders.

"Karma is a ..., and relentless",gambler1621,4222950,278449,"This rider got what was coming. The ping came in the early am. I showed up to the pickup location and had a feeling it was not correct. So, I called the rider and found he was at the end of a very long driveway about 1/2 mile away. He didn't enter the correct pickup. He said he was going to airport, so I bit the bullet and went to him instead of making him correct it. He also said his previous driver left him in the driveway with his bags. I thought to myself, WTF. I get him loaded and the destination shows a movie theater. Upon asking him he says to go to airport. While I changed the destination, he informs me it isn't necessary, then proceeds to tell me how Uber pays me and how to get to the airport. I normally would of kicked him to the curb, but felt adventurous. After we are under way, he tells me his plane LEAVES in 45 minutes. We are 40 minutes from the airport. Did I say he had 4 bags? He then commits a cardinal sin. He said I should drive just over the speed limit. I told him that I would do what I could to get him to the airport as quickly as I could. He then confided that he lost his ID the night before. So naturally I ask, How are you getting on a plane without an ID? He thought he could ""figure it out"".We all know what happened...The first driver started trip, then customer went inside to get something. The driver saw the destination and ended trip as he left since the pax was being a jerk. Because as the customer said, ""entering the correct pickup and dropoff is not necessary.Karma stepped in and forced me to drive UNDER the speed limit due to heavy rain.When he got to the airport, I am sure he was laughed at by the Southwest agent. Oh, you want to get on the plane that already boarded, you have 4 bags, AND you have no ID?I wonder if he ever realized that had he entered the correct destination and pickup that the first driver would of arrived at least 5 minutes earlier and would of taken him to the airport in time to catch his flight. His obstinance cost him at least 45 minutes.Loss of his ID, that was just Karma slapping him really hard."

Has anyone drove for Z-trip?,jfinks,4205228,276819,"Lol, nope. This is Uber People, not Ztrip people.From what I heard you pay for your own gas and before you get paid you owe $80 to the company. Per mile rates are higher. But you are on the hook for 80$ a day and the time it takes to get that before you make anything. Actually a little more since you will burn some gas making that 80. So pretty much everytime you go drive you are on the hook for 2-3 hours of work to make the 80 and then more hours for yourself.I can only imagine what that does to you at tax time. You have to keep track of all gas and actual expenses, no standard mileage deduction."

Has anyone drove for Z-trip?,jfinks,4205577,4205392,"It goes to car maintenance/purchasing and other business operating expenses.The $80 is per day. Not sure how it works, but I assume when you log in to the app you are minus $80. With the rates they have, it would only take a couple 20 mile or so trips to get out of debt for the day. Like a trip downtown and back. $80 sounds like a lot to an Uber X driver, but at regular cab rates that add up pretty quickly. Now getting rides with uber/lyft taking the majority, that is another story."

Now I don’t plan to get into all the shitty things that riders do or how oblivious they can be to common sense. I am referring to the traffic patterns and what the area is doing down there.When I first started to drive the pin locations SUCKED. Since that has been improved it has been a little better. What happened to the designated area for Uber driver to pick up? I am sure the Z-trip folks had something to do with it now that they have a dedicated area to stage.What I don’t get is all the merchants down there and public safety people should be interested in making a safe place for people to be dropped off and picked up. Now I am sure a lot of those feel they don’t need to worry about it and people will still come regardless of what happens in the area.Two questions, how do you handle Westport area?

A lot of this lays on Uber's shoulders, the Green Light needs to organize and setup a designated pickup and drop off. Mill street from Westport to Gold's gym is perfect for this, they already have it gated off so no one parks there.There should be one place for all pickups and drop offs by all transportation services. Drop offs happen very quickly, it is the pickups that hold things up. Riders need to call the driver as soon as possible to let them know where they are and the driver can let them know where to go if needed, can also confirm the car type and color also. Pickups need to happen much more quickly. Soon the pickup time will be 2 minutes before a wait time is charged so riders need to get to the pick up area as fast as possible."

Has any one else figured Westport out?,jfinks,4170847,174004,"Just said ,Westport between Mill and Broadway until around 3:30Am or so until the crowd leaves. The other roads are closed as need, usually after some emergency incident."
Has any one else figured Westport out?,Baitmen,4170865,4170847,They closed it down at Bridger and Westport road this Saturday at 1:45 am for example.... it seems for the sole purpose of letting Cabs in and controlling traffic. I understand they close down the main streets in Westport where you said but that is not what I am speaking about. I did not hear anything happening on the police scanner nor from my KCPD buddies that happened at that time. Seems silly as a passenger having to walk blocks away potentially when they have the Uber pickupzone for a reason. I have never seen the cabs have to go to a different location because of some sort of incident.
Has any one else figured Westport out?,jfinks,4170899,174004,"Ya, it is city vs rideshare. The mayor owns a piece of the KCTG, or has been bought by them. So anywhere that is possible to try and stick it to UBER/LYFT they are. Westport, Chiefs games etc. KCPL also. The police are controlled by the Mayor so are instructed to disrupt any ride share activities as much as possible."
Has any one else figured Westport out?,kcdrvr15,4174421,4170899,"The police are mostly on off duty jobs, where they do what the property owner wants, not what the contractor drivers want. This is where rideshare lacks, the taxis and limos can line up, then the pax comes to the taxi/cab stand and gets into the next vehicle. With uber/lyft, the pax has to find his driver, which may be parked along with other drivers, not in any order either.Try going down to westport in the middle of the day, drive around, see where there are spots to pull up and wait for a pax to find you, trying to learn how to drive and the area at same time, in the middle of the night is not the best way to orientate yourself.There are now signs on westport road, starting just west of Mill street, on North side it says no parking except ride share service vehicles, on the south side it says no parking taxi only.I avoid the late night bar rush, too many drunks and nothing good happens after 11pm anyway."
Has any one else figured Westport out?,jfinks,4174437,174004,"Just because they are off duty doesn't mean they can't use their general authority to move you.That's cool about the signs, didn't see those the other night. The only good thing that happens after 11 is surge rides. I don't accept anything less than 2x. Lately I have been calling it quits around 1 or 2 am. Especially if I am south KC area."

Has any one else figured Westport out?,jfinks,4205283,0,I give them one shot as I drive through Mill street or down Westport road. However if it is a 2x - 3x+ surge I will give some extra effort in getting them in the car. Lately though I haven't been staying out past 1am or so.

uber driver/uber eats,Johnriii,4190392,276272,"Ok, so my assumption was that once I got signed up as delivery driver for UberEats, then the flip over to UberX driver wouldn't be so difficult. it literally took almost a month to be cleared for Lyft (driver) and UberEats. now I'm being told that I would need a ""separate"" account to be an UberX driver. Ok, that's fine...but how exactly does that work? do i need a separate Uber app? can you HAVE an extra Uber app?

A ***** in Uber's Armor,jrel,992320,68376,Never chase a surge it will more than likely be gone before you get there. What you can do is check the rider app for places with low driver ratios and create a surge in that area by turning off your app until it does surge then turn it back on. We do this in Miami and a lot of the drivers in the morning it works out pretty well. You must have a lot of drivers aware of it or it will not work though. One driver could ruin it for everyone.

Driving Sunday’s in KC,,257915,0,
Driving Sunday’s in KC,kcladyz,3901066,257915,Hello.I am new with Uber. Picked up my first rider today and it was a good experience. . I plan to drive mainly Sunday’s can anyone give me good advice on a good place to position myself on Sundays? It seems like as soon as I get to a hot zone it disappears off the map. Lol. I plan to drive mid morning to mid/late afternoons.It seems like I hardly get requests and it’s exausting driving around.I apologize if this is a repeat thread. Please be kind. I am new to this forum and everything
Driving Sunday’s in KC,jfinks,3901121,257915,"Sunday can be pretty random. Don't chase the ""hot zones"" or surges. If you are in MO already I would hang out in Independence, Raytown, or Lee's Summit. If there is a Royals game on Sunday try to be at the Stadium at about the 7th inning. You might even have a couple drop offs at the Stadium earlier in the day. In the afternoons I have gotten random Business travelers heading to the airport for the upcoming work week. Check for concerts or shows at the Sprint Center and the Legends area.And don't forget about Uber Eats. There have been constant 2x boost promotions for Eats during certain times of the day and in different parts of the city. I generally hate Uber Eats especially when it is really cold out. But now that it is warmer it isn't so bad. Just try not to drive more than 5 minutes for a food pickup unless it is 2x or higher boost or surge."
Driving Sunday’s in KC,kcladyz,3914603,257915,I drove 5 trips today. Seems like downtown kansas city sucks for you get out of towners and people with luggage. I went to overland park and did 5 trips made $52. It was a much better experience and god traffic is so much better in Johnson County. Its also more pleasant with 1 passenger instead of 2
Driving Sunday’s in KC,wakydriverkc,3917939,257915,Do church folks take Uber? Might try being near a big church when service is over.Should be able to catch folks leaving hotels (usually 11am-noon). Might get an airport run.I NEVER chase surge on the map. Disappears on me. Every. Time.

Finally accepted my first ride at 6:25AM. Drove until 1:30PM.275 miles. 174 of them paid.12 Uber rides. 5 surge. $120 revenue (including tips)5 Lyft rides. 1 PrimeTime. $75 revenue (including tips)Great Sunday.[NG]Owner"

Driving Sunday’s in KC,bpsa1,3937049,257915,Decent Sunday here. Took somebody to Manhattan from the Greyhound Terminal at 1.4x on Uber. Stopped in Topeka on the way back and did some Lyft (the fares there are pretty decent).

I do not see how this can be profitable without tips. All trips were fairly good but kinda ticks me off for a few long trips I had should have been tippedClick to expand...A few general tips that you might already know: Setting a limit to the distance you are willing to go for pick-ups. If you are driving over 10 minutes for every request, you won't be playing this game for long. In my experience, Uber pick ups are pretty spot on or over estimate what the time says, while Lyft will say ""request 10 minutes away"" but it's usually longer than that. If you aren't already signed up with Lyft, I would suggest it. Not because it's better - but it gives you more chances of making money. I'm sure I could find my code if you needed one.Tips from pax are quite random. Sometimes the seemingly well off couple that is going downtown to a fancy restaurant and seemingly had a great ride won't tip a dime. Other times the guy wearing sweats and a t-shirt that only gets to see his kids on the weekend will hand you a five spot upon exiting.If you are trying to do this as a full time gig (from what I've heard/read) it can be difficult to be profitable in general with ride-sharing. You may not have the flexibility, but driving during the surges and weekend is what's going to make you the money.As far as my Sunday - I was working on a weekly UberEats quest (5 deliveries gave an extra $20, 10 total deliveries gave another $20). I ended up doing 4 deliveries today to hit #10. Drove 46.3 miles, earned $44.51 + $10 tips - note that there was a 1.4-2.1x boost all day. Crazy to me that some person paid $28.00 (after tip and Uber service fee) to have their On The Border delivered.Around noon I saw that Overland Park was briefly at a 3.0x surge and I was smack dab in the center - couldn't catch a ping :/"
Driving Sunday’s in KC,bpsa1,3937286,3937263,"Got $136 after surge, before $20 tip. 121 miles. Made about $30 in Topeka on Lyft."
Driving Sunday’s in KC,thelungmeister,3938017,3937263,"Dude... This happened to me on Friday night on my way home. I had my home set as destination, and suddenly found myself in a 3.1x surge all the way up state line. The dark red went from holmes all the way to metcalf from 435 to 151st... it was one of the biggest surge areas I've ever seen. It was about midnight and I was wiped out, but I decided i'd take advantage and shut off my destination and then just drove down 135th thinking I'd get something... but I didn't get a single ping... so I just headed home and kept the app on... the surge was there til i got home... i was pissed... like it was taunting me"
Driving Sunday’s in KC,jfinks,3938178,257915,"Ya midnight can be weird, it is like the uber system is trying to position its drivers for a bar rush in about an hour or so. The riders also know about what a regular ride costs from that area and wait until the surge goes away. Example you can be right in a surge area at 135th and get no rides. Then when surge goes away all the sudden rides start coming in. Don't be an uber chump and accept any rides after that. Just drive away.I just don't take rides in those areas unless it is 1.5x or higher, preferably 2x. and up. It is 3rd shift, my time is worth at least time and a half at all times on Friday and Saturday night + an additional .5x for drunks."
Driving Sunday’s in KC,Baitmen,4169266,3923640,How were you averaging almost 30 dollars a ride on a Sunday without surge? Was it XL or LX rides?
Driving Sunday’s in KC,NGOwner,4170737,257915,"Yes, Art Deco runs both X and XL.I'm just X.[NG]Owner"
Driving Sunday’s in KC,Baitmen,4170762,257915,I have never made that much with non surge on 7 rides and I have been driving for 2 years That's like the equivalent of getting a ride from southern KC to the airport 7 times in a row. If they posted a screen shot of it maybe I would not be so sceptical.

How are weeknights,jfinks,2497508,167755,I try to a couple of nights. I try to get a ride up to the stadium if the Royals are in town. Sometimes there is a trip from Overland Park hotel area to Airport. Then I stage at airport queue and try to get a ride back. I usually don't wait more than an hour though but usually get a ride in less than 30 minutes from the airport to somewhere south. It's all base rates but sometimes in the evenings you can make 50 in 2-3 hours. Actual road time with a rider is around an hour or so.
How are weeknights,that one girl,2563863,167755,Has anyone had this happen to them?Tonight I was in a surge area out skirts Westport and around. all a sudden I get a ride request from 20minutes away and completely out of the surge. If it's surging why aren't they sending me to riders in the actual surge opposed to being pulled out of a surge area too pick up 20 minutes away. If this has happened what do you do?
How are weeknights,jfinks,2564390,167755,"Just ignore the request. My rule is no more than 8 minutes or so or 2-3 miles for a pickup. Sometimes it can say 12 minutes and it is 3 miles, and I will take that. But if it is a good surge and I am close I ignore everything but surge.On a weeknight there are far fewer drivers out so the system was trying to get you to another area. Don't let the system rule you. The mileage limits that I set are also dependent on what direction they are taking you. If it is 12 - 15 minutes but it is taking me closer to home or another hot spot then ya I'll probably take it."

Kenny Chesney,dogmeat,4124936,271820,Probably too late but I did two Kenny trips today. They made a yellow X on my windshield (at the entrance) with a marker and they let you drop off pax wherever. Super crowded. First trip took nearly an hour from Waldo to Arrowhead.
Kenny Chesney,kcdrvr15,4125502,271820,How much was the fare for the Waldo to Arrowhead ?
Kenny Chesney,dogmeat,4125779,4125502,"My bad, was near Waldo. It was actually a PV address. $33.15 with 2.2x surge (51 minutes, uhg).I hope my fellow KC drivers took advantage of last night/tonight. From Friday night/Saturday morning starting at 12:30am till now: $1.26/mile on 210 miles so far."

No mess, and both tipped well..."
Kenny Chesney,dogmeat,4128943,271820,Saturday ending up being my best day/night with ride share. It was my first experience with an Arrowhead event as a driver outside of a cake walk royals game. I now know to utilize the visitor center across from TBell rather than fight my way through the stadium parking lotAlso note I saw sitting water in the morning around my spare tire from the leaky cooler. Got an extra $40 on top of the original $40.Pax was charged $180 (with fees) to go from Waldo to OP. Can guarantee they didn't like that.
Kenny Chesney,jfinks,4132144,271820,"What a Zoo.... I had a couple run ins with the concert. First was from OP on Lyft with a little prime time, three girls from South Dakota going to the concert. It wasn't clear where to let them out so I dropped them by the visitors center.I ended up out east in Blue springs for a long pickup and 1 mile trip... Sucks, but I was going out that way to hang out with some friends so wasn't too bad.So I login way out in Blue Springs, on Hwy 40 east of Woods chapel a little. I get a 1.8 long pickup at the stadiums. I was thinking about heading that way anyway so I took it. I got there and it was a mess. The rider had requested way on the south side of arrowhead parking lot over by the practice fields. There was no way to get over there so I couldn't get close enough for a cancel fee. I waited in traffic and texted if they still needed a ride. They said no thanks. It had been about 20 minutes or more since I initially accepted the ping. After that I couldn't cancel, I think the cell service was so loaded I lost connectivity to the platform. I even rebooted every thing and still had the ""Andy"" trip on screen. So I finally got out and back around to Blue Ridge Cutoff and was able to release the trip. I drove away going west on 70 with constant 5x pings. I ignored them, not going to go back into that mess. I ended up going downtown and got a decent 2.8x to Shawnee area, then another 2x surge going from Shawnee Mission Pkwy down to lenexaish.Took one ride from a bar spot in OP around closing, then headed home for the night. All in all not bad night, but could have been much better."

Dashcams... Yes or No?,thelungmeister,3752374,248788,"Sorry I'm blowing up the threads here. I started 4ish weeks ago and I have so many questions. I usually go to YouTube for general stuff, but I'm curious what the local drivers think.I currently use a Samsung Gear 360 camera mounted to my dash and record whenever I have pax in the car. It gets 4k video of the full 360 view of my car and the road. Since Ks and Mo are Single Party Consent states for surveillance and since I obviously consent, I don't have any legal obligation to to ask their permission to record since the camera is in plain sight. Most of my riders ask what it is since 360 cameras do look kind of weird. I tell them and when they ask if they are being recorded, I tell them ""Yes. I just have it there for liability purposes so a passenger can't accuse me of texting and driving or sexual harassment etc. The only people who would ever see the footage would be Uber Corporate, The Police, my wife and/or me. Their response has always been a variation of ""That's a really great idea, I'm surprised more Uber drivers don't do that.""Do you guys use dashcams or 360 cams in your cars when you have pax. If so, why or why not and have you heard positive or negative feedback from people who do use them."
Dashcams... Yes or No?,Shea47,3758283,248788,I looked into it and the only cams worth having that will give clear pictures inside and outside day or night are in excess of $400.00 and I just cannot justify spending that much. I have full coverage insurance and my agent assured me that the add on charge would fully cover me outside of whatever uber paid or didn't pay and I am extra cautious anyway and have never had an accident and most pax are no trouble at all. I just don't see any reason to spend money on the cam at this time.
Dashcams... Yes or No?,thelungmeister,3759206,248788,"At night, it does get dark, and it's impossible for it to see the back seat unless the dome lights are on. You can see the road pretty well and me because of the ambient glow of the uber nav on my phone. And it picks up really solid Audio.

How was this weekend?,dogmeat,4086287,269490,"Last night ended up with just over $1.00/mile after tips with over 100 total miles. Learning that I might need to save myself and not ""waste"" time looking for rides during the morning/day and just go hardcore friday/saturday nights.Did you end up turning on the app out there?"
How was this weekend?,arghcd,4086296,269490,"No, I was way too intoxicated to try it. But yeah, I was tempted. 1.00 a mile with 100 miles is not bad.."
How was this weekend?,dogmeat,4087604,269490,"That was for the entire day. Before 6:00pm I was in the dumps. Caught a late night 1.8x from One Block South to Westport and 1.5x from Westport out to 123rd and Roe which helped salvage the night.Used to not want to get involved with the drunk crowd, but I've realized it's nothing that I haven't dealt with in the past as I've been the DD of my group of friends for the past 15 years."
How was this weekend?,Scott Jackson,4088561,269490,"Sucked!! I tried going during the day to try to get some pax, thinking that during a holiday weekend, it would be great. Welk, I drove all around town and the best I got was a $10 trip from Midtown to the North near Zona Rosa. I made $40 on Saturday and $35 Sunday.I think I'm going to take everybody's suggestion and hit it hard during the night on the weekends, even though I'm going to be have to be hassling with the drunks."

Acceptance rates?,thelungmeister,4077841,268936,How big of a deal is your acceptance rate with Uber and UberEats?
Acceptance rates?,NGOwner,4077877,268936,Acceptance rate means bupkis.[NG]Owner
Acceptance rates?,gambler1621,4080409,268936,"Acceptance rate is directly proportional to your profit. The higher your acceptance rate, the less money you make after expenses, generally speaking. The longer you do this, the better you become at screening out unprofitable pax. Your acceptance rate will drop until you maximize your profit per hour, then it will stabilize. Where it ends up is different for each driver."

New Procedures for the new Cerner Complex,CEP3,4059703,267797,"Hello All,I have had regular drop offs at the new Cerner complex off of Bannister and Hillcrest, and normally the rider just hands me their badge to scan at the gate and I go and drop them off. They are stating a new policy where you have to “check in” in the left most gate closest to the security building they will then give you a plaque according to the security guard so they can keep track of who is coming and going in the area."
New Procedures for the new Cerner Complex,NGOwner,4077872,267797,"Yeah, this happened to me as well.But they only get you on the way out, because you can't get out without the rent a guard raising the gate.He said what you wrote, and that they'd take down driver's license information and address.I said, ""I have a better idea.

She was not a happy camper, no drivers avail, no taxis, had to wait over an hour. I just smiled and told her to email lyft, that as a driver on the lyft platform, I dont set the rates."
KCI primetime,KC_Ride,3828458,253360,Well how often you get a premium ride in KC? Once or twice a year. KC is a slow place for premium drivers.
KCI primetime,kcdrvr15,3828607,253360,Couple times a day.

KCI primetime,kcdrvr15,4032064,253360,"update, nice lady that was upset with lyft on her prime time ride from kci, well she called me and booked a trip directly with me, both pickup and return, kci to downtown hotel. I charged her $69 plus tip each way, and she left positive feedback on my Square Point of Sale account.On lyft premium this would have cost her right at $60, and the driver would have gotten about $45. By marketing myself directly to the rider, via a simple business card, she decided on her own to call me and book directly with me, bypassing lyft because she thinks they are a greedy company, just like fuber.I just love it when a plan comes together."
KCI primetime,jfinks,4034234,253360,And this is why a lot of premium rides aren't available for drivers. I think that was an illegal street hail.I'd keep that type of stuff quiet. It wouldn't be hard for Lyft to put 1 + 2 + 3 together and figure out who you are with the info you gave.Remember you are really just another car on the road without Uber/Lyft. You do have full commercial insurance right?
KCI primetime,kcdrvr15,4036223,253360,"No, not illegal in my market, yes comm livery ins, and lyft already knows, there are dozens of 'livery cab' operators here in KC."

So, Just's a head's up. I could have misread the starting date, but it looks like it's going to be St. Patty's style closures every weekend this summer.

Uber Revenue vs Lyft Revenue,,265082,0,
Uber Revenue vs Lyft Revenue,NGOwner,4017053,265082,"I've always wondered why it seemed to me that for the same ride, Uber paid out less than Lyft. And markedly so for longer rides. I just had the opportunity to actually compare my take from an Uber ride and a Lyft ride from basically the same location.Here's the tale of the tape.Uber: 38.66 miles, 40' 47"". $31.80Lyft: 36.94 miles, 38' 5"". $38.52I then dug into how Lyft calculated what they paid me. And I learned something. Lyft has different payrates depending on which side of the metro you're on. I did not know that.Kansas Side (what we get):Base Fare $0.75Revenue Per Mile $0.94Revenue Per Minute $0.075Missouri Side (what we get):Base Fare $0.825Revenue Per Mile $0.6825Revenue Per Minute $0.1125So Lyft is actually paying us an extra $0.26 per mile for all pickups on the Kansas side! That's 38% more!Food for thought .....[NG]Owner"
Uber Revenue vs Lyft Revenue,dogmeat,4018388,265082,"I've also noticed that Lyft pays better than Uber. 2 issues I have with Lyft: there are a lot more Uber requests and Uber will surge while Lyft has that little pink box at P&L.Minimum fare for Lyft in KS is $3.00, with Uber it's $2.66."
Uber Revenue vs Lyft Revenue,jfinks,4018440,265082,"Ya Lyft is considered Lawrence area, Uber's rates in Lawrence are the Lyft KS side. I have asked a few lyft riders how they compare on the KS side and they said Lyft is usually a little cheaper even though the per mile rate is higher. Lyft is probably a little closer to the 25%/75% with lower up front pricing is all I can think of. Uber is taking more from the ride and that makes them more.Lyft is crazy on pickup distance sometimes. I ignore them but wow. I was driving on College by corporate woods and got a request for Missie B's. I think this was tuesday at 2 am or so. It said 20 minutes, but I think it is a bit more than that."
Uber Revenue vs Lyft Revenue,thelungmeister,4019470,4018440,ya... um... no thanks... that's nutty
Uber Revenue vs Lyft Revenue,jfinks,4019536,265082,nutty people too...
Uber Revenue vs Lyft Revenue,Mighty Mo,4022530,265082,"I always found the opposite. When I'm driving Fri's/Sat's, I have set out a few times to drive Lyft only. Only to end up doing Uber for sheer volume of requests, theres a lot of Lyft drivers. Seems to be a lot less Uber drivers, more pax & more $$$."
Uber Revenue vs Lyft Revenue,jfinks,4022741,4022530,"He was just comparing Uber vs Lyft income, not ride volume.Ya I agree on the Lyft volume. I recently started with Lyft after uber for for 1.5 year or so. I give Lyft a chance each time but Uber beats them out on requests. There is an old thread from a year or two that talks about uber having a way of knowing you are doing Lyft also. It is probably through some sort of behavior pattern. So Uber throws you more requests to try to keep you from going to Lyft. It was one of the reasons to go dual platform, to try and get Uber to wake up on your requests."
Uber Revenue vs Lyft Revenue,Mighty Mo,4023097,265082,"Wow that's incredible, I'll bet it's true too. Wouldn't be that hard for either app to be aware of the other running in phone processes.Now both app's have an onscreen popup when you move off or away from the app to another screen.I would like it if it were just a little smaller and more out of the way.I also happen to enjoy that Uber has the ability to queue up passengers, something I have not noticed if it is there, but do not think Lyft has.On a busy night, short drivers, that ability alone could multiply your rides by a huge amount.But this is all off topic of thread, it seems for me running both apps back and forth accordingly to whichever is either 1)busy(lots of PAX) 2)paying more at the time, or various other reasons to me is the best way to make the most cash.Brand loyalty is just where big business want their prey."
Uber Revenue vs Lyft Revenue,kcdrvr15,4032006,265082,"Both companies got into trouble with the apple and google play stores, the processes for an app to monitor other apps, ie uber drivers app can tell if your using another ride share app, it can tell if your phone is jail broke, or if your using any of the gps spoofing apps. These companies (fuber/gryft) will break every rule and regulation the can, and will continue to do so until forced to stop. The app currently can and will tell the servers just about everything you are doing with your phone."

Ubereats Quest deliveries not being counted..,jfinks,3945417,259506,I will if it is 2x+ and not late night. It is actually pretty good then. Otherwise it is a 30 minute ordeal for each order for sometimes 5 bucks or less. The tips can be better on delivery but no guarantee of that.

Ubereats Quest deliveries not being counted..,Mighty Mo,4021000,259506,"Had this issue myself a few weeks ago during same promotion.

Apparently the promotion was for Colorado, and we, or at least me, were getting it here in KC. I pushed the issue hard at them that it did not state Colorado anywhere, not my problem, pay me.Finally after way too much effort I received my compensation.With the additional 40$ it wasn't that bad of pay, without it, the deliveries were not worth it.Anxious to see if deliveries by themselves are better as the pay I have read is increased now.Also, is anyone else in KC getting ANY ""Quest promotions"" at all?The above has been the only I had seen, and the only one since then.Thanks."

I'm still under 2mo's and just get excited and hit accept. But I am still overall happy with how much I've made to what I've spent on gas.

I'm going to assume either the greenlight hub in each area is in charge of promotions and quests, and/or corporate is and they just haven't done it or nailed down the details(how to maximize their profits while encouraging the most drivers to be on the road).I'll be ready when they are though, have you seen some of the quests other cities get?! I've seen on here some people throwing out ""50 rides, +170$""...That's nuts! I'm ready now!"
Ubereats Quest deliveries not being counted..,jfinks,4025701,259506,"Actually I was mistaken, the boosts were for just a small patch area of independence so not really anything.I did a couple deliveries today. First one went ok, it was a little longer pickup than usual at 10 minutes but I was heading in that direction anyway. Got to the Goodcents and the dude handed me an empty cup and the other stuff in a bag. I made him fill it, I said we don't fill drinks, we don't even know what the drink is usually. He said it was a Sierra mist. I downrated them for ""poor packaging""...Second trip was dumb. Another 10 minute pick at Planet Sub on Antioch and 127th st. While driving there I was hungry so called ahead and ordered me a Mega Roast beef. I picked up the orders and headed out. About half way to the destination I realized I was delivering to the other Planet sub on 119th and Black Bob, lol.. Jesus H what a moron. So I call while driving and get the guy on the phone. He said oh ya it has done that before. No you dummy, YOU have done that before. He said what apartment complex he was in but was vague and I asked him to change the delivery address. Not sure if you can on delivery. He hangs up and I proceeded to the original drop off, the other planet sub. Waited for 10 minutes or so while I ate my Mega Roast beef. Finally ended up canceling. So far made 8.32 on the trip and scored 2 sandwiches and a greek salad. Went home and put in the fridge. lol"
Ubereats Quest deliveries not being counted..,Mighty Mo,4025914,259506,"Lmao, that's insane how does someone plug in the store twice as their destination. Awesome stuff, and yeah, I haven't been asked to fill any drinks yet, but will not be having any of that.Haven't as of yet had lets say the, gall, opportunity or nerve if you will to cancel on a delivery order underway, but it sounds tasty and profitable.Do you know if UberEats has a limit on orders you can pick up at once place?Example, picked up two seperate orders at a bar, and then as well saw right behind me saw two other drivers picking up.Why would I not have gotten all four of them!? I'm hoping it just came down to timing of accepting the actual order pings."
Ubereats Quest deliveries not being counted..,jfinks,4026333,259506,"Ya it was all timing and probably some limit set so the food has a better chance of arriving faster and warmer. It could be the destination of the orders, if they are too far apart then probably will go to another driver. If they had 4 orders all in the same apartment complex or close to, you might get them all."

Uber/Lyft trade dress?,CEastwood,3997756,263957,"Hi all, so, while I have driven for U/L for 3 yrs now here in San Diego, my ex gf is starting driving in KC, and she tells me that they don’t require you to have any signage on your cars is that true? It’s just that here in California they require signs on both the front and rear windows but none whatsoever for you guys? Is that a good thing?"
Uber/Lyft trade dress?,dogmeat,3998539,263957,I haven't put any U or L stickers on my car and I've had no issues.
Uber/Lyft trade dress?,gambler1621,4004487,263957,"It is not required in KC. As a personal defense instructor, i discourage it for 2 reasons1. It makes you a target for predators who want to car jack you. They know that L & U prohibit drivers from carrying a means to defend themselves.2. They are paying for drivers, not. moving billboards."
Uber/Lyft trade dress?,thelungmeister,4004816,263957,"Honestly, If I were a rider, I'd prefer the car to not have any signage. I think it looks tacky and makes it seem more like a business transaction, rather than ""ride share"". One of the reasons i like driving for Uber is that it almost feels like I'm ""giving a buddy a ride"". As soon as you put one of those dumb Lyft or Uber lanterns on your car, you immediatly become a taxi. I saw this dude driving around westport the other day in an newer Escalade with a lift on it and massive rims, and then magneted to the top of his car was one of those taxi signs that said UBER and on the hood was one of those stupid looking pink Lyft signs. My first thought was: There's no way he's profitable in that thing... my second thought was: That look horrible. I went by the green light downtown the other day when I was bored and asked some questions and wanted to see if they had an Uber bumper sticker. They have no stickers and they don't recomend using them in KC. That's my 2cents... I have MANY more opinions based on Gambler's 1st point, but I'll save that for another day."
Uber/Lyft trade dress?,Mighty Mo,4023118,263957,"Haha, I agree they can make the vehicle look tacky. Not always but sometimes.Mostly though, it bugs me to see other Uber drivers with the LED amazon bought one. I mean, I'd put up and use either Lyft or Uber's version of the beacon/dash thing, but I'm not going to pay for it. Nope.And then only because it might actually help find the PAX, which could potentially increase the $$$ I'm making."

Vomit,Balex1122,3359077,224600,So someone just puked in my car but her friend gave me $50 cash tip so I wouldn't report her to uber should I still report her since half of my back seat is covered
Vomit,arghcd,3359322,224600,"Sorry, to hear about this! Here's what I would do.. I would use the app to report that this passenger left something in the car. They were so drunk they may think this is probable..you get their personal # from uber and then negotiate an additional fee. Ask for whatever you think is fair to get it clean. I wouldn't try to get an uber standard fee because the passenger may report that you already got some money. This could be bad for your hustle because uber treats this like extortion.. Sound like a plan?"
Vomit,JT21491,3360062,224600,"I had the same thing happen last night, (first time for me). Mine wasn't all the bad, it mostly got on the door and window as she was opening the door to puke. I took pictures but there's really nothing to see. She took her coat off and wiped it all up pretty good. Her husband gave me $20 cash and a $10 tip in the app. It was about 1am and I was about ready to go home anyway, so I'm just going to chalk it up as experience. Probably take me 5 minutes to clean the window and door panel.In your case there's 2 things to look at. If it got all over your seat and you have to have it cleaned, you probably need to report it. The 2nd thing to look at is, did you have to quit early and cost yourself money. If so, you probably would have made more than the $50 cash he gave you, AND you still have to clean the car."
Vomit,jfinks,3361338,224600,"Just be honest with uber puke support. After they tell you how much the cleanup fee they will give you, let them know the rider already gave you $50 cash. So if Uber would give you 80 for that cleanup, just ask them for the difference which is 30 and they will bill the rider for the difference."
Vomit,KUBriguy,3362269,224600,I would go the route jfinks suggests.
Vomit,PlanetShuttle,3670615,224600,"The first time it happened, I was offered money and then refused it. I don't want those people thinking they can pay me for puking in my car. If rider doesn't want to pay the fee again, then rider can learn to abstain from too much alcohol. Consequences! Uber paid me $150, but I've heard it be as high as $250. Now, I always have 2 0r 3 plastic baggies in my glove compartment, and I refuse the ultra inebriated folks. Nope, won't do it."
Vomit,Shea47,3758270,224600,I'll tell you that Uber will only give you 80 dollars and it will cost you about 125.00 to get it cleaned and that is from me having to go to 2 different places because one place only did seats and the other only did floors. And I had to go the night it happened to a self serv car wash and use carpet spray and the vac system to deep clean the bulk of the problem out of the seat and floor as well as clean it as well as I could. It was my second pax for the night so I figure it cost me about 400 dollars in lost ride fees and I was beyond pissed.

Stupid question from someone thinking about driving,Art Deco,3815272,252297,thelungmeister you are mistaken. You pay income tax on the rides origination. For example if you pick up a pax in OP and drop at the airport you pay income tax to Kansas and conversely if you picked up a pax at the airport and dropped em in OP you pay Missouri income tax. Your mileage deduction will cover all or most of your income so there isn’t much tax to pay.

For example, professional athletes have very complicated returns, they have to file in every state they play a game in, it's a royal pain (see what I did there for you KC people). From a practical perspective the states will go after athletes but do you think they will go after an Uber driver? I doubt it because it's probably a wash for them and the driver, what you pay as a nonresident comes off your resident tax. Oh, and then there's the fact that we don't really make anything."

Voice & data have never worked simultaneously- it's either one or the other unless on WiFi.Did something change?If I have the app online (data) & receive a call (voice) it cuts data off meaning my connection to the app is now broken until I end the call.
No request coming when you are on the phone?,gambler1621,3874599,256140,"Check with the Sprint store in Town Center or on Sprint campus. Many phones on Sprint do not support data and voice simultaneously. I heard that some do, but you have to change some settings."
No request coming when you are on the phone?,thelungmeister,3874980,256140,"So, I worked for Sprint for 8 years. Both in S&R, sales, product development, and network forcasting. So, here's the deal. Sprint and Verizon both use CDMA networks. T-Mobile and ATT use GSM networks. Think of it like AM and FM radio. All sprint devices roam using Verizon towers, and visa-versa. Same with TMO and ATT. GSM phones use Sim Cards. You can pop your sim into any device that also uses a SIM and your number moves over. When the invention of the ""mini SIM"" GSM carriers were able to separate the data and voice functions of the antenna to allow you to browse and take calls provided you were connected to an LTE or roaming data signal. CDMA is a more secure network, but it has an IMEI code on the phone where the ""sim"" is built in and you actually have to have your carrier move your number from phone to phone. Because of this, there was just one signal. For the most part, it's only been with specific Sprint devices where mobile data (MD) and voice (V) have worked simultaneously. Back in the day, the old Palm Windows devices allowed you to use MD+V together, but if you used any other windows mobile device or a palm with Palm OS on it, you'd only have one or the other. Then Sprint came out with WiMAX (the original iteration of 4G before LTE) and that used 2 separate antennas, one for the 4G data where available, and one for voice. So, the 8 or 9 devices made with the WiMAX tech were able to do MD+V for a while. Then, LTE took over and that used the same antenna as the voice so you were only able to do one or the other. Since Sprint switched to LTE, there have only been 2 phones (Samsung Note3 and 4) used separate antennas for MD and V, so, with them you were able to make calls and browse, but no other Sprint Devices were capable of this unless you were connected to WiFi. This led to quite a few people (myself included) holding onto our Note4's as long as possible. Now that CDMA carriers use LTE SIM cards, they finally are able to Split the signal. But, with Sprint, they haven't allowed any devices to utilize this function until very recently. Right now, i believe the only sprint device you can get MD+V on is the LG V30+. I'm not sure about the S9 or S9+, but I will check when i get home because my wife just got her's today. Moving forward, according to Sprint, MD+V will be pretty standard especially when they start rolling out their 5G networkFor those of you on the ""pre-paid"" plans such as cricket and the walmart companies (This excludes Virgin and Boost), Most of those brands use ""dual Sim"" tech. Where they use CDMA for Voice and GSM for Data. That is why if you have these pre-paid companies, you are usually able to browse and make calls at the same time.In case it wasn't clear, you must have a data connection in order to receive ride requests. So, right now, if you have Sprint, Virgin, or Boost (I'm not positive about Verizon, but they are overprices a-holes, so it wouldn't surprise me), if you want to make a call and still receive ride requests, you have to be connected to WiFi.I may have just made this a bit more confusing, but I tried to explain it to the best of my ability. Hope this helps."
No request coming when you are on the phone?,gambler1621,3875238,256140,"I likethelungmeister's response. If it is over your head or reading it gives you a headache, go to one of the Sprint stores listed in my previous post and ask them. They should tell you if you need a different phone to have MD + V simultanieously. The reason I recommend those stores is because they are ""corporate"" owned stores.

No request coming when you are on the phone?,thelungmeister,3875756,3875251,"yes and no. only certain devices now, but all moving forward from my understanding.It's funny, you say that, though. Sprint was the first for most of the cell phone stuff. First Color phone, First Camera phone, First Cellular PDA, First with a Smart Phone, First with unlimited data, First with unlimited texting, First with 4G, will be the first to deploy 5G. The problem with being first to all that stuff is it's easy to screw up because nobody has made the mistakes to learn from yet. Sadly, Sprint was the one to make those mistakes. Now, they are being super hesitant to blaze any more trails. They actually have a museum on the Campus of all the things they were first on bating way back to the United Telecom days"

What is a premium ride request?,ScubaSteve2177,3856259,255065,"It means you may get a long pickup fee. In other words, drive a long way to pick someone up for less than a dollar."
What is a premium ride request?,IERide,3856285,255065,It's a way that Uber baits you into thinking that if you drive all that way to pick up a pax for their $2 ride that you will get some kind of a bonus.. You DO get a 'premium bonus' but it's usually $0.10 to $0.75 ...Dont fall for it!
What is a premium ride request?,jfinks,3856373,255065,"I think the bigger premium is if they cancel when you are almost there, I heard anyway, but I never encounter this because my max pickup is always about half the 11 min threshold for a long (premium) pickup.There are exceptions, if it is nice surge I might go for it. Also one thing that can happen, and it is a gamble, if there is a long pickup way south OP or way way north of Gladstone, there is a good chance it is a long trip into the city. Not always, and it can depend on the time of day. So sometimes if it is slow I might do a long pickup south or even way out west on highway 10. It costs 50-80 cents in gas usually. That is all the Premium pickup is paying for, but it isn't compensating you for the opportunity loss of a short pickup and long ride. For for the most part the long pickup fee isn't enough, but that is par for the course for Uber. Pay as little as possible."

I went off line, requested a premium ride, and it hooked up with my mystery guest, only now he's 10 min away. I screen shot his profile, and then canceled.If your using gps spoofing, your cheating and stealing from other drivers.....Don't worry, I won't turn you in to lyft or uber, but come on man, you can't be that far from your spoofed location, the riders will see your a couple of min away when they request, then when you accept, it says your 10 min away. This will set warning flags with the alog and will end up with you being deactivated.Be safe"

In San Diego Uber and Lyft referral bonuses aren’t what they used to be but is Kansas City even offering any bonuses to new drivers? Also...how’s business on the weekends (Sat and Sun she’ll be driving) Thanks in advance for your input… Greetings from San Diego"
Driver referrals in KC?,thelungmeister,3834717,253673,"For some reason, My referral location is set at ""Topeka, Ks""... not sure why. I activated my account in Ks using MunchKym's referral. My amount for referral when i started a couple months ago was $50, but i noticed it went down to $25 at the beginning of April. I usually drive on Friday and Saturday nights and on Sundays before and after church. I put in about 16-20 hours. and i'll make between 500 and 600 with tips with those hours. Just make sure he pays attention to events at Sprint Center and SEC Arena. Airport is kind of worthless for me unless you get a re-match. I've discovered that I will get a re-match every time when Drop people off at the KCI Marriott, so I'll hangout at Zona Rosa because that's usually where people who stay at Airport hotels will go to eat. Another thing I'm finding to be super lucrative is to check for big wedding announcements in the paper, then scan facebook to see if you can find where the wedding is. Or, if you know some wedding Photographers or DJ's, you can find out where they are pretty easily. If you just hang out within a few miles of the location, you can see some pretty hefty surges pop up way out in the sticks because you have 200-400 people get drunk at a wedding at a farm and it's 45min to an hour drive to get home. I made 7 trips to this random barn wedding north of the airport a couple weeks ago and made 550 with tips in 4 hours because it was a 3.2 surge and i just made sure to turn off new requests til i got back close to the wedding location. There tend to be a ton of weddings and receptions at these quaint barns out in the middle of nowhere at farms. April, May, and June tend to have hundreds of these weddings every weekend."

My overthinking brain tells me there may be more people who want rides because they don't want to drive in bad weather... But of course there will also be fewer people who actually want to go out.Do you guys notice any benefits to driving when it's snowing? Like... I was planning on driving on Friday night, BUT it's supposed to snow. My car and I do well in the snow and poor road conditions... But, are there usually enough people needing rides to spend the time out there?"
Snow day,randogg,3807380,251990,"I almost don't want to post this because it's seemed like my little secret for a while but...In my experience. Bad weather days are by far and away the most lucrative. If you feel comfortable driving in bad weather you can rake it in.Drivers tend to stay home which drives surge pricing up all over the city. People still need rides so the demand is still there.I made a quick $150.00 on Easter Sunday between 3pm and 5:30pm granted, the bulk of that was a $80 airport trip from 119th and Antioch then a quick rematch back south.Thought it was somewhat of a fluke being Easter and all but I pretty much had the same experience Monday morning. even though the roads were fine by then, it still seemed like most drivers stayed home.You just need to be careful and more alert which goes without sayingFriday evening might be a little different though just fyi. I've only driven bad weather days during Sundays or week days early mornings.Fridays the uber pack comes out in force so it will be interesting if some snow keeps most drivers off the road"

Any advice for a newbie,gambler1621,3799213,233578,"1. Never forget you are driving for the sole purpose of making a profit. Maximize revenue per hour and minimize expenses.2. Don't let anyone treat you like a slave.3. Riders with low ratings (below 4.7) have them for a reason. The reasons are different for each, but other drivers showed their dislike for them.4. Long pickups (over 8-10 min) will cost you money in the long run.5. Some riders are a$$holes, don't let it ruin your day.6. Driver ratings don't pay the rent or make you extra money. Don't worry about your rating unless it drops below 4.8. Deactivation usually happens below 4.7."

At kci,louNkc,3747428,248520,does everyone think its better to wait at the airport during the day or troll downtown and alike for small rides?
At kci,jfinks,3747808,248520,"If you just dropped off at the airport, hang around the terminals for 10 minutes or so for a rematch. Don't stop, just drive around the terminals a couple times. If nothing check the lot C queue. I would stay up north instead of downtown unless there was a big concert or other event at the sprint center. Downtown can be pretty stupid, lots of silly min fares that take 10-15 minutes each because of lights, traffic and trying to find the riders. They a lot of times just end up going a half mile or so from an event to the PL District. Every once and a while you will get a nice ride out of down town going south to mission or Overland park or further."
At kci,louNkc,3747848,248520,"All very good advice thank you very much, just started doing this about a week ago and got the weekend which was very nice. But I know that Uber isn’t always like last weekend was LOLI wasted about two hours today doing the airport waiting thing, exactly what you told me not to do (didn’t know yet) LOL but hey I’m already here and now there’s only one in the queue ahead of me so I guess I better go ahead and wait here."
At kci,jfinks,3751203,248520,Ya you will eventually get a ride if there aren't many in the queue. With the rematch at the airport it changed the lot C game a lot.
At kci,bestdriver,3752011,248520,So not anymore rematch at KCI?
At kci,thelungmeister,3752046,3751203,Game? What game? I'm new
At kci,jfinks,3752771,3752046,"It was more of a waiting game. However I have heard stories of drivers teaming up to stay in queue. Using multiple devices, having someone hold their uber phone for them while they take a lyft ride. Or maybe in the long term scheme of things at the airport you could hide a phone under a car, go take another ride for lyft and leave your uber phone in queue. Not sure how they did it but I heard some games were being played.With rematch a lot of that is gone, it almost makes no sense going to the lot c to wait anymore. If you don't get a rematch it is probably a bad time to be at the airport anyway, when not many flights are coming in."
At kci,thelungmeister,3752916,248520,So. i dropped a guy off at the airport and saw that airplane on the map that said 54 in queue... But i got a ping almost the second i dropped the guy off... What is rematch
At kci,jfinks,3752949,248520,Thats it.
At kci,thelungmeister,3752967,248520,What does it do?... I noticed it was sitting in the middle of the tarmac... Unlike the one at the Sprint Campus... So I couldn't get close enough to actually fit in the queue... But I still got a ping from terminal C anyway
At kci,jfinks,3752977,248520,The Queue is in Economy Lot C. Rematch attempts to match you with a rider soon after dropping off at a terminal.
At kci,thelungmeister,3753000,248520,"Ah. So, why so many cars in the queue?"
At kci,jfinks,3753013,248520,"I don't know, kinda dumb but whatever. This time at night lots of planes coming in. It is usually a 1-2 hour wait for a ride with that many. More maybe with rematch."

At kci,KC_Ride,3797232,248520,Last Saturday 3/31 waited 1 hour 50 min get a ride. Made only $17 . There were 6 cars ahead of me. Next time I would not wait.
At kci,jfinks,3797259,248520,Wow what time?
At kci,KC_Ride,3797346,248520,It was about 8 am ish
At kci,jfinks,3797377,248520,"Ya, on a Sat AM you need to look at flight stats site, usually the first plane in is around 8am. That means you got to the lot around 6am after a drop off. Planes leave early Sat AM but first passenger planes in are usually around 8 or after on Saturday. You shouldn't have waited for sure at that time, just no ""customers"" coming in at that time."
At kci,dogmeat,3797713,248520,"Finally had a ride to KCI this afternoon. Had to drive over ten minutes to get the pax, but the $38.00 fare was fine by me. The queue was 40/42 Lyft/Uber. Is there really that many drivers up there waiting? Even if the majority are using both platforms, what are people doing?"
At kci,jfinks,3797796,3797713,"If it was in the mid afternoon a lot will wait in the lot for a ride. 40 isn't too bad, that should be an hour or so wait. If they get a long ride to south KC that is $40 for about 2 hours waiting and driving. Some will run both Uber and lyft, accept the trip and start to see if it is a long ride, if it isn't they will take the hit cancelling and wait for lyft ride. Silly game. I think in that 2 hours I could make $40, but that is spending gas/mileage."

UberEats,jfinks,3796798,212475,"It may be a different percent in each market, I heard it is more like 18% of the ticket goes to Uber. The person ordering pays $5-8 depending on distance. Uber has been putting a lot of incentives out for eats drivers, but not regular uber driving. I don't think deliveries are popular among drivers but more will do it if the incentive is high enough. No drivers, no deliveries = no revenue. I am sure eats is a much more complicated system since 3 parties are involved with each transaction, Uber, person ordering and the driver."

I was pissed at that point and finally cancelled the rest of the trip and chose ""rider not here"".This mutha***** had the unmitigated gall to contact uber and have them allow them to call me so he could tell me he didn't appreciate me leaving without them!! I told him that he CANNOT make drivers wait that long and it was very rude of him. I said he needs to request a ride when he's ready to go. I am still astonished at his boldness in contacting me.

Try to make a mental note of their rating when you initially accept, if they are re-requesting and the same rating pops up you know it is them again. Last thing you want to do is pickup the same riders you just canceled on for no show, bad rating for sure.I've dropped off at a quictrip and they said they would be right back out for a return trip home.

Uber & Lyft,cujodu,3695236,244236,I signed up with Lyft and promptly quit after two weeks. I got screwed by Lyft on an airport cancellation. The riders seemed shadier. No more tipping than Uber. Shorter trips in general. Not a fan.
Uber & Lyft,JoeBuckYourself,3696094,244236,"I also stopped driving for Lyft after a few weeks (was running both platforms at once), but this was about 3 months ago. The request were usually 10-15 minutes away, and the rides I did accept were either from out of town (and decent) or locals that were below average at best. I also got screwed out of a couple of cancellations. I was hoping it may get better over time in our market."
Uber & Lyft,Shea47,3758305,244236,Lyft has picked up as of late and I am thinking of quitting Uber all together since they are really screwing drivers and soon they will be screwing all drivers everywhere. I recently found out they took 80% of one driver's fare. The fare was about 117.00 and they gave him 21.00. They did not give him any of the surge but only gave him 2.00 extra for it instead as a fixed amount. So Uber is not only screwing drivers out of surge pricing but also taking way too much for their share. Fu** Uber seriously.

And if you are trying to make this argument using straight division you're being disingenuous. The booking fee has to be eliminated from the calculation, as we've never been given a portion of that. And if you have the supplemental insurance (like I do) you have to add that back in, as that's really a part of what you are paid out.So in my case, here are some examples.A typical min-ride in my market (.88 miles, 4 minutes):Rider Paid: $6.71Of that:Uber's Booking Fee is $2.80.Uber's Service Fee is $1.25Uber's Payment to me is $2.66 (I received $2.63 as it includes a debit of $0.03 for supplemental insurance)Straight percentages ($2.63/$6.71): 39% for me, 61% for Uber. (Cue Outrage!)Actual percentages ($2.66/($6.71-$2.80)): 68% for me, 32% for Uber (Still some outrage ... where's my 75%???)Let's look at a typical mid-range ride in my market (14.5 miles, 17 minutes):Rider Paid: $23.15Of that:Uber's Booking Fee is $2.80Uber's Service Fee is $7.67Uber's Payment to me is $12.68 (I received $12.13 as it includes a debit of $0.55 for supplemental insurance)Straight percentages ($12.13/$23.15): 52% for me, 48% for Uber. (Cue Outrage!)Actual percentages ($12.68/($23.15-$2.80)): 62% for me, 38% for Uber (Still some outrage ... where's my 75%???)Now let's look at an atypical mid-range ride in my market (15.7 miles, 22.5 minutes):Rider Paid: $27.04Of that:Uber's Booking Fee is $2.80Uber's Service Fee is $5.96Uber's Payment to me is $22.28 (I received $21.69 as it includes a debit of $0.59 for supplemental insurance)Straight percentages ($21.69/$27.04): 80% for me, 20% for Uber. (What? Whoah!)Actual percentages ($22.28/($27.04-$2.80)): 92% for me, 8% for Uber (Hot damn! That's why I use Google Maps rather than UberNav!)Let's look at a longer ride, an airport ride (47 miles, 46 minutes).Rider Paid: $53.49Of that:Uber's Booking Fee is $2.80Uber's Service Fee is $12.51Uber's Payment to me is $38.18 (I received: $36.43 as it includes a debit of $1.75 for supplemental insurance)Straight Percentages ($36.43/$53.49): 68% for me, 32% for Uber (Still some outrage ... where's my 75%???)Actual percentages ($38.18/($53.49-$2.80)): 75% for me, 25% for Uber.

That should help."
average payout?,NGOwner,3672102,227108,"I've been doing Uber since 7/2016 and Lyft since 11/2016 in KC. Both UberRazor and jfinks have been here about as long as I've been, but I have a different opinion than theirs. Earning $400 a week consistently from a single platform is hard. On you and your vehicle.It requires driving bar closing shifts (which I will no longer do) on Fridays and Saturdays. Primarily to catch the surges that hit at those times. And you'll have to deal with the risks and issues with those who utilize the TNC platforms at those times.It requires luck in getting morning airport runs and Rematches back to the southern suburbs on a regular basis.It requires a lot of miles driven at regular rates because catching a surge during the days and evenings in KC is like finding a leprechaun painting a rainbow while riding on a unicorn.I keep meticulous records of my Uber/Lyft activities. My average revenue for 2017 per mile driven was $0.61. Meaning that to gross $400 per week, I had to drive on average ~655 miles per week. Every week. 93 miles a day. Every day. Every single day. Of every single month. For an entire year. 33K miles a year just for TNC driving. Think about that....2018 is looking better at $0.66 per mile driven, but it's still early.Yes, I've had $400 weeks on a single platform. In fact, I've cracked $1000 in one week combining both platforms. But those are the exceptions. Not the rule. Budget $250. Maybe $300. And be happy each week you beat that.Driving for a TNC is is a side gig. Or a cash flow stop gap. This is not a profession. You'll burn out, flame out, or crash out before you ever cash out.[NG]Owner"
average payout?,jfinks,3673962,227108,My 400+ was based on late night driving on Friday/Saturday then 2-3 evenings during the week. So ya if you aren't going to do that and get those 1:30AM to 3AM surges then 400 a week is going to be a long grind.
average payout?,thelungmeister,3751159,227108,"I've been putting 5hrs on Thursday nights, 6 on Fridays nights, and about 8 or 9 on Saturday evenings. I've never made less than 455 a week with tips. I assume that's mostly because March is a big drinking month. I've also found that Sunday mornings between 8am and 11am in the suburban outskirts are big dollar times because people need to get back to their cars in westport or downtown. I've seen some surges in that sunday morning time frame in the 3's"
average payout?,jfinks,3751187,3751159,"Sounds reasonable. I have seen those Sunday AM surges also, but after being out for a long Sat night into the Sunday morning I am usually just laying around ignoring it. I figure it is a combination of what you said, car retrieval, then some church goers maybe, then mix in some business travel out of MCI for the next week. Couple that with a lot of drivers like me that already did a late night, there might be a shortage of drivers on the road."
average payout?,thelungmeister,3751223,3751187,I put in 12hrs on StPat's day then went to my Chruch's 1st service on Sunday morning then ran car retrieval 9a-2p on Sunday morning and made bank. Big tippers too cuz they still had cash from the night before. I could tell I was one of the few out there because I was getting 15min pickup requests to OP right after dropping somebody off in Westport. This happened at least 7 times.

Child Car Seats,kcguy68,3584651,238260,I think the news report was a very poor effort from KSHB. They were trying to play the whole thing up like ride share companies were putting your child in danger. The real person putting the kid in danger is the parent who is willing to take a ride without proper restraint. KSHB was very lazy in reporting this story.
Child Car Seats,reo47,3586600,238260,"I don't think they're right about the Missouri Taxi exemption applying to Uber and Lyft or other ""rideshares"". When I checked on this last year we weren't included in the exemption, only taxi company's etc. Unless that's changed recently."
Child Car Seats,jbudb,3590949,238260,"Is anyone else having problems with pax who request multiple stops and your don't know until you get to the first stop that they are picking up kids from school/day care? They don't have car seats and your choice is to leave them at the curb or take them without a car seat. I know what I'm supposed to do, but it is hard to just drive away from poor folks.Another problem is that when I tried to cancel a multi-stop ride after the first stop was completed, I couldn't do it. I got a message telling me to finish the trip and then contact Uber for fare adjustment etc. I may have misunderstood, but that's what I saw."
Child Car Seats,JoeBuckYourself,3591211,238260,"I had that happen to me once, picked up a woman and her destination was a school. She changed her destination on the way to back to her home with the school being a stop. I was caught off guard by this, and ended up taking her and her son (maybe 7 years old) back home as it was really cold outside and was only about 1 mile. I one starred her, and I think that means I won't be matched up with her again?Trying to blame Uber for people putting their own children at risk is ridiculous."
Child Car Seats,jedofarc,3593206,0,"So the multiple trip thing is a major Pia for instances like this, and I dont know what you all do, but seriously consider saying no to kids who should be in car seats. Let the pax cry all they want, let them get out too if they want because if you get pulled over with a kid who's could be in a seat in your car its your ass not theirs. Nothing like going down for child endangerment for a $6 no tip fair. Plus if lets say you get in a wreck and the kid gets hurt? Yeah... you get the idea. No amount of hearing a pax complain is worth that..."
Child Car Seats,reo47,3596082,238260,"Uber should weigh in on this. Will Uber's insurance pay for a child injured while riding without a car seat? If not, will your personal insurance pay? Could be setting up for a major personal lawsuit against you. The story about picking the child up at school with the parent is a tough one."
Child Car Seats,jedofarc,3599383,3596082,"It's not really Uber's call... its the law. Even if let's say Uber insurance and lets say it carries $200k worth of coverage (Its way less than that I think). If you do something like, let a child ride in your car illegally, that kid gets hurt bad, his parents sue you. Even if Uber insurance kicks up max coverage, its still your ass for whats left. Now I guess... if you don't own a house or really an property you can declare bankruptcy and liquidate. But if you do... you could lose everything, even if their insurance covers you, and Uber can't (and certainly wont) take responsibility for you breaking a law thats already on the books. Honestly, if its me, I get a mom who multi trips, and next stop is to pick up her kid from school who legally should be in a car seat, she can get out if she wants but its really not worth it to us to take that risk, its us taking the risk, not Uber or anyone else. Just my two cents."
Child Car Seats,gambler1621,3616319,238260,"Until ALL drivers start leaving these irresponsible parents on the curb AND reporting them, it will keep happening. Uber and lyft have no financial incentive to stop it and million$$$$ of incentives to let it continue."

I've only had to use the booster a couple times in the 3 weeks I've been driving, but usually when i offer it they tip pretty decent so it's been a plus thusfar. I understand not everybody has room in the boot for a carseat and luggage for a possible airport trip, but, there needs to be a way in the Uber rider app to request a driver with carseats, and in return a way for drivers to specify they have carseats available. I feel like this wouldn't be such a difficult option to add to the app. I'm sure I'm not the only driver out there who has kids and pulls carseats out when I'm out for pickups."

My day as an uber rider. :-(,jfinks,3728450,247297,"I needed a ride during lunch today to pick up a Moving truck.First up was Kulwinder (note to self always cancel a driver that is at 4.6) - This piece of work was less than a half mile from my office and took 5 minutes to get here. But he didn't actually get here he went to the wrong office building and sat there. Made no attempt at all to contact me. He cancels and I get charged. I see him drive by in a dirty old grey civic, I flipped him off. I still needed a ride and got him again so I cancelled, again, cancelled, again cancelled, again cancelled. I got him one more time and let him come here for a minute and had a few words with him and a few more fingers.... What a piece of work this a hole is... I was standing out in the parking lot right by my carefully placed pin. Anyway...Finally requested again and got someone else. She wasn't that far away but for some reason took a really long route to get to me. I'm not sure if she was trying to get a long pickup fee or what, but she finally gets here after 10 minutes which should have been 5 minutes. She gets here and she has someone in her front passenger seat. WTF is this, we don't have pool in KC. I didn't press the issue, I just needed a ride. Her car is overly scented with some stuff and I still smell like it after an hour. We chatted a little bit after I told her I drove uber also. She got me where I needed to be so that ended ok. She is gonna run into a situation where a rider will report her or she may need to take 4 riders in UberX. How is she a 4.9 rated driver I don't know.The 3rd guy shows up, brakes are fubared, has all 4 windows down. It was nice out so not a big deal but still windows down I would never do unless a rider requested it. Not a terrible ride, until he almost blew right through a stop sign. Slammed on brakes and stopped half way into the intersection.Crazy, is this what Uber X has become?"

Unfortunately, if we start giving lower ratings to our riders, they will retaliate with low scores for us, and then that happens we may lose the ability to drive.

Long pick up fee,jfinks,3372638,225115,"It is supposed to be 9 minutes. I never hit it because the max I accept is about 6-8 minutes. They have some safeguards built into it like you have to have progress the whole time toward the pickup. If you wait 2 minutes to start moving then this can be deducted from the forward progression time.Pretty much it is a nice gesture, but is a stupid implementation like a lot of things they try to do.

Long pick up fee,gambler1621,3664920,225115,"That has been my experience with the long pick up fee. I very quickly moved back to my normal pickup time restrictions and low rider rating restrictions. I personally use 10 minutes and 4.70 rating. Anything longer than 10 minutes away or a rating below 4.70, I don't even say no, I just ignore. Once I implemented by 10/4.70 rule, my income increased about 20% per hour worked and my driver rating went up. I am wondering what would happen if I changed them to 9 minutes and 4.75 rider rating? I work in the Kansas City Area."

It was under 20 in Line so I stuck it out for about 35 mins (not bad).This morning had a request in S OP to airport and upon drop off in terminal B - once I circled through terminal C I received my rematch. It was glorious. Proceeded to terminal B for the p/u and off to 135th in OP.Obv it all depends on how busy the airport is at the time of drop off and request timing.

Airport Wait Times -- Post Rematch Launch,randogg,3535395,230582,Absolutely agree. Completely hit or miss. There's still enough airport squatters to keep the que somewhat high... Should never take 2+ hours during peak arrival times with 36 people in que. Which has happened to me twice now
Airport Wait Times -- Post Rematch Launch,NGOwner,3535507,230582,"I'm all for Rematch. I come down squarely on the ""this is very good"" side.Since Rematch started, I've missed a Rematch twice in the ~15 Uber trips I've taken to the airport since it started.That means ~13 times I've gone to the airport and back away from the airport with substantial fares.In my opinion, the key is not to wait if you don't get matched. Ever. Never ever. Economy Lot C is a fool's errand. I'd rather burn through 20 deadmiles back into the city and start earning again than wait 2+ hours for my next fare.What I have experienced though is a metro-wide Uber ping slowdown after a Rematch. For example, if I get an airport run and then a Rematch, over that 90 minute period I can easily be over $40 an hour gross. I've read that Uber tries to equalize hourly earnings across drivers; meaning, the gross hourly rate earned over X hours (2 hours? 3 hours? 6 hours? App hours or clock hours?) by each driver plays a role in how Uber distributes pings to drivers. If you've had a couple of long rides, you get the dregs for while (if you get any pings at all), until your average hourly rate comes back down.I don't know if it's true but it feels directionally correct. I've noticed that Uber pings dry up after a long airport run and a long trip back. Were it not for Lyft pings at those times, I'd probably just point the car towards home and call it a shift.[NG]Owner"

If you received a ticket for this, then you need to do 2 things: 1 fight it in court. 2 File a complaint with the police dept against the officer who wrote you the ticket.

I'm also taking classes to be a Real Estate agent, so I'm thinking of my car purchase as one of my main investments as a RE agent and I'm 99% committed to buying an AWD Toyota Previa MiniVan, Black, fully loaded with Black leather and navigation. (These things are not cheap. If you have an appreciation for Minivans, these things are quite awesome, actually.)I'd drive for Uber/Lyft 4-12 hours per week, probably monday mornings and friday evenings. Currently insured by Geico.SO. How popular is Uber XL? Are there lots of early monday morning rides from Overland Park to MCI? I'm thinking 5 am - 9am. And possibly Fridays, 5pm - 9pm. Not going to be hunting surges, no pool or uber x, not working Holidays since I get overtime + holiday pay for that from my main job."

Received a call from Uber rep today,Art Deco,3408122,227674,After hearing Overland Park was giving out tickets I went to city hall to get the proper license. There was a problem with my Uber waybill which shows the certOf insurance. So I popped over to the OP greenlight and spoke with the Uber rep.He called me back this morning and all of the tickets given out have been recalled and are not valid. In addition a taxi license is not needed by Uber drivers so don’t waste your time.Also regarding the rematch he sort of told me drivers would be rematched to pax that we’re taking shorter rides. So a driver doesn’t sit in the queue for an hour and finally get a ride and find out it’s to the Airport Hilton. I got a rematch yesterday and it was from the rental car area to just north of Zona Rosa.Hope this info helps
Received a call from Uber rep today,jfinks,3408225,227674,"Thanks, I just called before reading this and can verify that Uber/Lyft drivers aren't required to have a city permit for Overland Park. I asked the lady on the phone if that info could be added to the site and she said she would pass it along to her supervisor.That kinda sucks about the rematch to a short ride. You could get into a short trip squirrel cage that are all nearly min fares. Hopefully after one short rematch they would send you a long rematch to get you out of the area."

Uber is a big network, rides can come from anywhere at any time. You can't really say what/where are the best times. Some of the best times are the hardest times because of the traffic.Yep, think of where people go and might need rides because of alcohol consumption. But uber isn't all about partiers, people need rides for all sorts of random reasons. Car broke down and is in shop. They need a ride to the store or from store to home. They don't have a car at all and they take uber's every where. Maybe they lost their license and need a ride to work. These are all random situations that Uber fills a need for."

"So wow, who was at the stadium for the Chiefs today?",jfinks,3305455,221143,"I haven't gone out there for any games this year. It was nice out so I left at the end of the 3rd quarter. I got there and the game was still going and there was about a 2.0 - 2.2 surge. I figured I would wait for a better time so I stayed offline. I had no idea they changed the staging location to the vistor's bureau. Wow that sucks for riders, what it if it is cold out like for the next 2-3 games? A lot are older and shouldn't be walking that far.Anyway the game was getting close to being over so went online and waited for the surge. And waited, and waited, and waited. Nothing nada. There was a blip of 1.2 which is sh!t. I am expecting to get a good ride at least 3x minium. Waited more, I bet I ignored 20-30 rides, I lost count, all base fares, I don't work on Sundays during a game for base fares. Finally it was getting late and wasn't sure how long this was going to last so I accepted a 1.4, reluctantly.... It was an easy pickup as the riders had already made the walk up to the pickup. We were off in about a minute or 2 of me accepting.Here is what I found out in an unrelated ride down town. You might have noticed Z trip getting exclusive rights to close pickups at certain areas. Here is the scoop on this from a rider. Mayor Sly James has some sort of investment in Ztrip and related companies that use the service. He is behind getting these venues setup with Ztrip. This is plain and simple collusion for profit by an elected official. Anyone know some lawyers that want to look into this?"
"So wow, who was at the stadium for the Chiefs today?",arghcd,3307257,221143,"Damn, I hate Chiefs home games. Arrowhead is such a clown show for all of us. Top it off with a loss and these rides are like transporting a bunch of angry animals back to their barn. I love the chiefs, but this lack of accessibilty for ride share in 2017 is an absolute joke"
"So wow, who was at the stadium for the Chiefs today?",jfinks,3307415,221143,"That is also why I won't do rides for base fare, but the passengers I have had haven't been too bad in the past. I haven't done many Chiefs games though."
"So wow, who was at the stadium for the Chiefs today?",aw99,3307480,221143,Me too. This year I have not been at a single Royals and Chiefs game. What's the point for so many drivers waiting and waiting out there to drive without surge? It does not make sense. I rather stay home and watch the game than driving with the base fare. We have so many drivers willing to drive for anything. ZTrip has for sure stepped up its game. The problem we have is over-supplied market.
"So wow, who was at the stadium for the Chiefs today?",jedofarc,3312635,221143,"So, like anything its a numbers game, but in general my experience has been Royals games vs Chiefs games are night and day. In general, the parking lot looks like what I imagine day 3 of Woodstock looked like after (and lets be honest and during and before) Chiefs games. The two that I did also took me longer to get in and out (much longer) than for Royals games. I must have done about 30+ rides to and from Royals games and the worst drop off I had were these three guys who did some pregaming and by all means were not bad at all, just felt obligated to tell me the history of Royals baseball and how when they sucked next year they were going to cry every night. Both drop offs I did at Chiefs games were fall down drunk and the one guy kept fu**ing hitting my window and threatening to fight every he saw without a chiefs jersey on because ""They weren't real fans"". I also had some woman almost throw up on my car, not a rider, just some drunk chick in the parking lot walking towards the stadium. I have officially retired from Chiefs games."
"So wow, who was at the stadium for the Chiefs today?",JT21491,3312934,221143,If everyone that went out there stayed offline until the game was over there should be a hella surge. That is if the surge works like its supposed too... the whole supply demand thing. I'm still not convinced these surges are real.Here's one from a few weeks ago that lasted about 10-15 minutes and I never did get a ride request.
"So wow, who was at the stadium for the Chiefs today?",UberRazor,3317128,221143,Unfortunately I too got caught up in the non-surge. It was terrible. Small blip. Sitting on both Lyft and Uber.
"So wow, who was at the stadium for the Chiefs today?",jfinks,3391243,221143,So during the Game Saturday night I was at 435 and Front street after dropping off up north. It was mid 3rd quarter so I headed to the stadium. Parked and picked up a 2x surge ride. While driving back I accepted a 2.8 surge that went to Grandview. While I was in GRANDVIEW I got a 4.1x request for the stadium. lol I didn't go back. It was worth going out there. I criticized the location of the pickup but it is actually much better than sitting in the middle of the parking lot going nowhere.
"So wow, who was at the stadium for the Chiefs today?",UberRazor,3396602,221143,Nice dude!!
"So wow, who was at the stadium for the Chiefs today?",jfinks,3396612,3396602,Overall last Saturday was pretty good. The most surge I have seen in a while. I went home early and played with bit coins. lol

(i.e... pick up in Gladstone, you stay in Gladstone, or pickup in Wyandotte County and leave Wyandotte and end up Olathe or Overland Park)I am finding that most rides take me out of the general area in which they originate.

If you drive in KC Metro from 7:00 am to 12:00 pm,NGOwner,3387347,226177,"Alright, I'll bite.1) 5-8. But my morning hours are more compressed than that. I generally start around 7:30AM and will not stay out past 11AM. Rides drop off massively after about 10AM, and don't pick up again until 2-3PM. And I'm tired of the early morning runs to the airport with no possibility of a pickup there for hours.2) Not meaningful. If there is no airport trip, there's a tight range, about $4-$8, for a total of about $40. If there is an airport (round)trip, the average skews tremendously as the total can run to $60 - $80. Obviously I want the airport runs.3) Never. I'm in SoJoCo.4) Depends on the number of cars waiting, time of day, day of week, and flights coming in. It's fluid. Though my general rule is: in the busy time, no more than 60 cars. In the non-busy times, no more than 20 cars. I don't want to wait more than an hour for a rider.5) I start in KC metro and end in KC metro. That's the only thing I can say with certainty.

I can find them for less than $25k, used but not certified by a dealer.INFINITI QX60 AWD Hybrid (SUV) costs about as much as the BMW 535D but could be used for more than just ""select"". If they're dependable then it might be more useful than anything else."

"Need to buy a car, how profitable is Uber Select - daytime/weekdays?",KUBriguy,3383539,3383134,"The Q50 hybrid does not have much trunk space at all. That could be okay if you don't have airport runs with luggage. I have heard the hybrid isn't as refined as Toyota/Lexus and Honda/Acura, but the Q50 hybrid is pretty fast. It is also pretty rare, so any repairs may be pricey. Still, I believe the Infiniti is the best value when you look at handling, tech, and roominess, and mpg (key feature for uber). I have a Q50 AWD Premium 3.0t. My only complaint is wind noise at highway speed.The QX60 AWD has the benefit of driving well in snow with high surges.Of course, everyone has different things they value more highly than others. So a great car for one person wouldn't be so for another."

They did take notes of everything, the girl in front of me had a laptop and was noting everything. So they are listening. What I gathered though is Uber knows about most all of the issues.

Airport Wait Times,aw99,3211936,214906,Good idea. These days I rarely drive to the airport. When I do I will add my time.
Airport Wait Times,KUBriguy,3218544,214906,That's pretty good. Select is about 3 hours when I do that. uberx is about an hour.
Airport Wait Times,GUNN3R,3243726,214906,"Been awhile since I have driven, and got a new car that falls under select. Showed up this morning to check it out. Showed 6 cars when I got in. Have had only Select to see what the wait is. Was figuring would give it to shortly before the 4th hour and swap over.All just to test what’s worth it, but fairly excessive for only 6 vehicles. When it states 6 is that Select only or just all in front of me? I’m at 3 hours currently and shows 2."
Airport Wait Times,KUBriguy,3243737,3243726,I arrived at 740a this morning and was number 7. I am select only. shows me as 4 now.

Airport Wait Times,aw99,3243840,214906,I am scared of the waiting to try select at the airport. Is there enough request for all of us there? I thought most people request x from the airport. Waiting for 3 hours seems too long.
Airport Wait Times,KUBriguy,3243868,214906,"I lose money on x, unless the trip is short (so the base rate helps on the mileage revenue) and the pax tips."
Airport Wait Times,aw99,3243919,214906,I know driving only X is a loss unless you do it for fun. I think if one has long-term plan to drive you should use 2 cars. One compact car like Prius for slow time of the day or week and SELECT for the busy season.
Airport Wait Times,GUNN3R,3243939,3243737,"Yep that would be me.I'm rolling on 4 hours now. Trying to decide if I want to go get another ticket and wait it out or pick up Select and head into town.I gave in. Figured I would test this out fully.

Airport Wait Times,jfinks,3287140,0,"Ya you might have to contact support on Lawrence/Topeka, it should be available. Uber eats isn't available in Lawrence, not sure about Topeka.The deal on Lawrence rates are good and bad. The per mile is 1.20 - % commission, and the booking fee is 1.70. That all sounds great but my experience in Lawrence is it is a lot of short trips. I've never driven in Topeka, but have tried when I was in town visiting, the per mile rate is 1.60 - % commissions. Again, expect a lot of short rides, Topeka is about 6 miles from end to end. A little bigger than Lawrence, but Topeka is further away.I am assuming that the rates are higher there to attract KC drivers to the market? Or maybe it is because of all the short trips? An Airport run from Topeka is estimated to be pretty good at over $100, but you will wait a while to get that."

Airport Wait Times,semi-retired,3354757,214906,"In the last couple weeks (Nov 20 - Dec 8) I have been conducting an analysis at MCI between 8:30 am - 10:30 am give or take 5 - 10 minutes, I wanted to see if the wait time was 1 hour or more, because in early November I was told by an Uber driver of greater than a year that he never waited longer than an hour before he got a ride. The average wait time has been 2 hours and 10 minutes. I get to the airport and I am usually between 50 - 55 in queue and the average rate of Uber pax is 13 per half hour. For Lyft I enter the queue between 17 and 21. When I leave the airport after 10 am the queue is usually in the 55 - 60 car range. From 11:30 am - 1:00 pm I have seen the queue upwards of 90 - 100 when dropping off a pax, which I just keep on driving out of the airport and this is a consistent variable. On Wednesday of this past week I got to the Airport at 7:59 am as I wanted to see if an earlier arrival time would get me through the queue faster, it did not, the wait time was exactly 2 hours and 10 minutes. The average fair that I have received going from the airport has been on average $14 - $16.The lesson learned... is to not go to the economy parking lot when the queue is greater than 30. My time is not worth 2+ hours in queue for a $14 fare that I could have picked up from a short drive or two back in KC Metro. But that is just my opinion."
Airport Wait Times,jfinks,3354832,214906,"I've written a little about this too in the past. I think you have to consider the day of week in that and time of day. You also have to consider how long you have been driving already that day because a 1 hour or so break at the airport sometimes is nice to have if you have been on the road for a few hours already. I think making a decision to not stay at 30 is too low at some times because I have seen that decay to a ride in 20 minutes. I have seen 60 cars go at a rate of a little less than 1 per minute. Some fares to south KC are up to $40. I would say Wednesday 30 is a good number that is a slow as I have ever seen it in an afternoon. Friday-Monday, I probably would stay at 60 in queue as long as there are plenty of planes coming in. You can check that in Flightstats."
Airport Wait Times,semi-retired,3356096,214906,"I did notice there was one day of the week that went faster than others during Mon - Fri and I have downloaded the MCI Airport app that tells you which flights are arriving and departing, not sure if that is the best app to use but it is the one I am currently using.Based on your reply, I will study the trends a bit more to determine if my original analysis needs to be ammended."
Airport Wait Times,UberRazor,3356523,214906,I’m not 100% sure but I believe incoming flights to MCI between those morning hours are very very light so it makes sense that the wait time is 2+ hours. I utilize worldairport guide to monitor and track incoming flight schedule.FWIW - in the morning hours before 10am I will only stay If the queue is around 60 or so. If I have an early drop off before 730am I’m hardly ever sitting to wait because I know the flights coming in are so thin.
Airport Wait Times,NGOwner,3357767,0,"I concur (though I use FlightAware!).Based on my experience, I think that the maximum number of cars regardless of time of day an quantity of inbound flights should be ~60.

Thanksgiving Week Bust,jbudb,3328582,219845,"I have a theory about Thanksgiving week. The airport was really busy but rides were scarce. I think people tend to pick up family themselves. They don't wan't to tell that beloved family member to take an Uber. On Sunday and Monday I got several holiday related rides to the airport. Maybe after four days, it is easier to just call Uber and get the relatives a ride. Everyone is exhausted by then."
Thanksgiving Week Bust,UberRazor,3336349,219845,I agree the week was generally slow but one of the busiest drinking nights of the year is always the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and I absolutely crushed it that night.

Airport queue and using your phone,,213276,0,
Airport queue and using your phone,JT21491,3185842,213276,Is anyone else having problems while sitting in the airport queue and you make a phone call it bumps you offline and out of the queue? You have to go back online and then you're at the end of the line. Only happens while sitting in the airport queue. Any other time you can use your phone and stay online?
Airport queue and using your phone,UberRazor,3185861,213276,Never had it happen. Sitting in airport queue right now and had a call with no issue.
Airport queue and using your phone,aw99,3188492,213276,May be you left the app in background for long while you were on the phone. Just guessing. Last time when I was at lot C I moved just a little bit when 3 cars were in front of me. All of a sudden the app refreshed by itself. I thought l lost my spot. Luckily nothing had changed.
Airport queue and using your phone,JT21491,3190157,213276,The app went offline. Had to go back online to be put back in the queue.
Airport queue and using your phone,jfinks,3209686,213276,Has anyone tried going to Lot C and getting in queue then leaving and head to the cell phone lot to wait?
Airport queue and using your phone,UberRazor,3209706,3209686,"Give it a whirl and report back!If I end up at the airport tonight or tomorrow morning, I'll give it a shot..."
Airport queue and using your phone,jfinks,3209726,213276,"Ya just not sure if they watch the lot for anyone staging there when they may not supposed to be. I ""think"" the only reason for lot C is so they can tally up how many ride share drivers are queuing so they can bill uber for usage. Not sure if the booth attendants just know an uber when they see one because of the phone mount. Then how can they tell a lyft ride from an uber ride?I just hate the long drive down Mexico heading to pick up when the cell lot is so close."
Airport queue and using your phone,zkunze97,3301514,213276,What the hell does the blue bars mean. Especially when the line is single digits?What's the longest anyone has waited with less than five cars in the queue?
Airport queue and using your phone,kcdrvr15,3301812,213276,"the uber app will time out and go off line if you move it to the background & use phone for more than two min. Lots of phones and services will provide data and voice, but not simultaneously. Check online if your phone model can do both data and voice at same time, usually only the top end phones will do this. One way to check, is open uber, go online, then make a phone call, (not thru the app) and see if the app goes off line after a couple of min. My lyft app works just fine in back ground with out any issues while in airport que, it's a samsung g6 and I'm on T-mobile.As far as wait time, depends on how many drivers and how many riders are requesting. Earlier in week, was at airport lot c, 50 drivers ahead of me (Lyft) and it only took 40 min to get a request. Other times I've been in lot c 2 hours, with only 15 drivers ahead of me, and ended up leaving after 2 hours with 10 drivers still ahead of me.Just some observations from last couple of years, Thanksgiving and Christmas travelers are usually met by family, so lots of travelers but not a high demand for ride share or taxis."
Airport queue and using your phone,zkunze97,3302684,213276,"That background part makes sense. However, I always hear about 30 queue and high numbers. I never see higher than single digits ever. Is this an issue? I never go to the airport because of it."

This week,aw99,3302228,220668,Well this tells you how morale is low. If drivers were happy they would not be rude. It costs money to clean a car. In my opinion every rider has to tip drivers in order to get better service. Right now over-saturation is the problem. We all are fighting for few riders available in our market. The per mile fare can not go higher because it discourages riders from taking rides. That's the reality we are facing.

Got a Meals request and was like f it lets see what happens. First time and bam the lady puts in the wrong drop off point. Ugh. There are 3 12005 Ash streets in KC area. One in Leawood, one in OP and one in PV.So at first she was annoying trying to blame it on me and I was close to just heading home and eating her dinner. lol Then she started to realize that she had messed up. So I drove abou 1/2 mile and dropped it off. She asked if I had change for a 10 for tip and nope I didn't, then she said f it take the $10. I think her dinner ended up costing $30 after Food, delivery and tip. lolI took a rider to Belton and did a few more eats trips down there. Kinda sucks cause at night you are trying to figure out where the right houses are. They could make this so much easier if they made the eater come out or at least be on the porch when you arrive. All in all it actually didn't pay too bad, I didn't have any Min fares like you would with a rider in the car. All deliveries were over $4 even for a short trip a few blocks away."

Anyone under 18 must be accompanied by someone 18 years of age or older on any ride.As a driver-partner in a city that doesn't allow minors to ride, you should decline the ride request if you believe the person requesting the ride is under 18. When picking up riders, if you feel they are underage, you may request they provide a driver's license or ID card for confirmation. If a rider is underage, please do not start the trip or allow them to ride."

Long pickups change,ScubaSteve2177,3177826,212629,What’s the change?
Long pickups change,jfinks,3177898,212629,Get paid distance and time on long pickup. It won't be for relatively short pickups like 2 to 4 miles. My guess is it will be for pickups over 5 miles away. It might be based just on time also.
Long pickups change,aw99,3179801,212629,The first 8-10 minutes pickup time would be as always free. For anything over that time we could get paid.
Long pickups change,jfinks,3179862,212629,"It hasn't been defined yet. My hope is 8 minutes or after 3-4 miles, whichever comes first. Yes I consider 3 miles or more a long pickup if it is not highway. After 3 miles the charges would start. They gotta find a way so drivers can't just wander around racking up more miles."
Long pickups change,aw99,3231749,212629,It is official and live in Kansas City. The question is when does the charge start? 8 minutes after or 3 miles?? It is not clear.
Long pickups change,jfinks,3231904,212629,It is after nine minutes. Kinda sucks but have to see how much more it actually adds to a pickup.
Long pickups change,aw99,3231968,212629,"Yeah at least we don't have to struggle to cancel some of these trips. I read an article that it would be 10-12 minutes. 9 minutes, I can live with it. Last Friday I canceled one 20 minutes away request and accepted the 14 minutes. I was wondering if I got paid for it. It looks like I was not."
Long pickups change,jfinks,3232018,212629,"Ya I might try a longer pickup now, overall I think it is a good thing. A lot of longer pickups could be nice paying rides. At least now it will pay a little to find out. The problem I have with the 9 minutes is it isn't a very good estimate a lot of times. It can easily turn into 5 miles in 8 minutes which is outside of my range that I am willing to take, and the pickup won't pay anything."
Long pickups change,aw99,3232099,212629,"My other concern is after 20 minutes drive, where are they going? It could be around the corner. On weekends, I pick up some young riders going to friends houses not too far."
Long pickups change,JT21491,3232386,3231904,"So if a pickup is 15 minutes away you would only get paid for the extra 6 minutes, or do you think they'll charge for the whole 15 minutes? If it's like the 11 cents a minute wait time it still won't be worth the extra drive time."
Long pickups change,jfinks,3232405,3232099,"Ya you always had that concern before, now at least you get paid a little for it the pickup and then the min fare.JT21491 said:So if a pickup is 15 minutes away you would only get paid for the extra 6 minutes, or do you think they'll charge for the whole 15 minutes? If it's like the 11 cents a minute wait time it still won't be worth the extra drive time.Click to expand...It should be for the whole 15 minutes, but I don't think it is."
Long pickups change,aw99,3232459,212629,I believe the extra 6 minutes is calculated for time and mile when you arrive there. Then you have to add their standard destination charge.
Long pickups change,aw99,3235242,212629,Just FYI...I made 0.21 cents for long pick up yesterday. The ETA said 11 minutes when I received the request. No idea why I got paid for only .53 minute or.21 mile. For now we need to write down the start and arrival time to find out the actual driving time to get to the rider pick up location.
Long pickups change,jfinks,3235380,212629,"You only get paid for the time over 9 minutes. It isn't retroactive to the start of the travel to pickup.So it is kind of like wait time, you only get it after 2 minutes."
Long pickups change,JT21491,3247429,212629,"Wait time went up to .21 per minute. In my opinion it should be .50 to $1 per minute, that would hurry people along. After all, time is money.At least when you're driving you're getting paid by the minute and mileage."

Queue,jfinks,3231202,216284,"It is possible a driver got a very short trip after waiting in queue. I think they get put back in the top of the queue if that happens. Example would be waiting in queue for 45 minutes and getting a short trip to a hotel across the highway. It is also possible that a rider cancelled and a driver got put back in a priority spot in the queue. I know one time I got a request and after sitting at the terminal and had to no show cancel, when I got back to the lot I almost immediately got a new request.In the past the queue only showed 1-10, 10-20, 20-30, etc, so you never saw the number move around.

Naturally, my pax was slow coming out and I was shaking like a leaf....as soon as a car started to drive between our cars, I took off like a jet so he couldn’t follow me and to put some space between us. No shots fired but it certainly felt like it was a baaaad spot to be in. Be safe out there everyone."

Halloween Rides,Uberguy711,3184879,213218,"I’ve been driving for a few months now just to make a little side money. I usually just drive Friday and Saturday early evenings taking the young crowd to the bars, etc. But I usually bail before it’s time to take them home. I don’t want to deal with drunks in my car if I can help it.However, this is my first Halloween and I’m wondering what everyone’s experiences have been in the past. Is it really that much more lucrative than other weekends? Should I just stick with my usual routine or is it worth it to stay out later? Thanks in advance."
Halloween Rides,arghcd,3188294,213218,"Hey uberguy711, in all honesty it's nowhere close to being as lucrative as some normal weekends. I dread holidays like Halloween, New Years aand St. Pats because frankly everyone comes out of nowhere trying to make money and ruins it for everyone's pocketbooks. It truly will be over saturated with drivers and frustrating as hell. Not to mention, the pickups take longer because everyone is doing last minute makeup and costume stuff in their mirror, or one last shot of alcohol. It's really not worth it, but please don't let this dissuade you from trying. It's just the sad reality.."
Halloween Rides,aw99,3188474,213218,arghcd said it nicely. I have done few Halloween weekends now. Nothing to be exited about. In my experience just young people need to move around town. Not too far. Even last year's new year eve was not that busy. Yes the area is over saturated with so many drivers. Go and look at power and light. Drivers line up waiting for request.
Halloween Rides,Uberguy711,3188625,213218,Cool. Thanks for the input guys.

Mystro,Cndragon,3203151,214481,"I tried it recently...it worked well for the most part, but even though I had my settings set for it to accept all rides automatically, when a ping came in it would give some notice asking me if Id like to override the settings and accept the ride anyway. Once I did that though, it would then shut down the other app and bring me back to the active one.So, for me anyway, wasnt totally automated since I had to manually accept rides, but at least I didnt have to worry about forgetting to log out of one app when accepting a ride on another. Also, destination filter is a no go...when I got a ping while on destination filter, it wouldnt turn off the other app."
Mystro,aw99,3203160,214481,Good to know. Hope they will make some changes In the future.

Later that morning, another pax found a license belonging to one of the ladies in the backseat. Unfortunately, it did not belong to the lady whom had paid for the ride.I took the license to the hotel where I had dropped the ladies off but I'm guessing they were sharing a room or something because the front desk did not have her name. The front desk did volunteer to put the license into their lost and found, so I left it there at the hotel. I had thought about mailing it back to the address on the license but there was no guarantee that the address was correct and I thought she might need it while she was in town. Any thoughts on what you would have done?"

Working full time now but started ubering again on the side. Where are some good weekday spots to hit? Also best on weekends to avoid Westport traffic...always worry about someone else hitting me. Live in union hill area in midtown for context...which I see as a decent area to be when I go online. Please any advice and tips.

Ubering again need tips,arghcd,3188305,213302,"Uber is in control, they might have been trying to lure you back in last Saturday...thats my opinion. The reality is that we are at the whim of complex algorithms and when they want you to take a ride they will dangle one in front of you and when they don't, they wont. Just go out and experiment, apply the scientific method. We are not your Game Genie here, but you best believe Uber is a game. And they will move YOU where they want you."

Wrong rider Sat night.,jfinks,3173456,212456,"A weird one Sat night. I pulled up for a pickup around 9th and Wyandotte down town. I rolled up and a guy was standing there and got in the back seat. Before I did a name check another guy jumped in the front seat so I figured they just had 2. The guy in the front seat ordered the ride, we had to kick the backseat guy out after the front seat guy said he didn't know who the other guy was.After that a guy bumped into the back of my car. No damage but rider was in my car, we just took off after a quick inspection. It was raining and didn't need to deal with any of that mess.Fun times."

So once he realized it was his that was getting stolen he dashed to the car before we could leave.Just posting this as a reminder to verify rider before letting in the car. It was dark, cold and rainy this night so it is too easy to let a rider in the car before verifying."

Not every short trip is bad,aw99,3158416,211475,Last week I got a request from OP Sheraton. As usual I went straight to the main entrance. My expectation was a nice long trip to the airport. Well everyone I look at is turning away from me. So I said what's going on...Where is the rider? Waited few minutes and then the rider updated his pick up location to the back area. I turned right on college and made another turn and there was Carlos waiving his hand to let me know where he is. Carlos said sorry we are not allowed to request ride at the main entrance that's why I am down here. He is an employee at the hotel. I joked with him I thought you're going to the airport. Carlos said one day. He was going few minutes away to his second job. I was happy to take that short trip.

Full time ride volume?,NorthCounty SD,3150991,211018,I'll be moving out to kansas city early next year (just got back from a week of visiting there) and lovely as my trip was i didn't see even one uber or lyft driver on the road my whole trip. I'm curious to know if anyone here is able to get enough rides to work for uber full time.
Full time ride volume?,jfinks,3151682,211018,Lol didn't see? Were you looking for stickers on the cars or just phones up on dash? I can't recommend driving uber full time. To make a decent living you will need to drive 50-60 hours a week which is way more than full time.
Full time ride volume?,UberRazor,3152790,211018,"Surprised you didn't see any drivers but not everyone has the stickers in the front window like jfinks suggests. I'm currently doing it ""full time"" to bridge my day job lay off to my next opportunity. You won't make a killing but it can be lucrative if you pick your spots and drive certain hours. My first two weeks of full time I drove close to 30 hrs. Not sure that truly is full time but it's doable; I just chose to limit it those hours for now. Next week will be a different story for me and plan on going all out to try to hit 40-ish. It's quite the grind and tends to wear on my body (and vehicle). Once you get started, keep us posted on progress...I'd be interested in how you do and your thought of the KC market. Best of luck!"
Full time ride volume?,aw99,3153130,211018,"I hate any sticker on my car. You don't see anything on my windshield. Incognito is the best way to go. I heard some taxi drivers slash your tires if they know you are rideshae driver. May be that's my excuse. I sometimes see new drivers decorate their nice cars on the sides, back and front with Uber stickers. You don't have to do that. It is not necessary.I am driving part time for a while now. Driving is fun just for few hours. It is hard on your body when you do it for extended period of time. I don't think I can drive full time. When the money was good it was not that bad. Now I feel pain everywhere."
Full time ride volume?,jfinks,3153171,211018,"Ya no stickers here either, but usually they are magnets though that can be removed.Remember to take a little aspirin when driving, it helps blood flow. I use Excedrin Headache stuff, get the generic. It has Acetaminophen and Aspirin, a little Ibuprofen helps also. Aspirin is a blood thinner and helps prevent DVT that can be caused by sitting for extended periods and is a general pain reliever all around. Younger drivers don't need to do this as much."
Full time ride volume?,aw99,3153239,211018,Thank you for your suggestions. Even my doctor wanted me to take baby Aspirin. I may need to start taking them soon. You see this forum has ideas for any thing.

Kansas Speedway,jbudb,3102918,207853,Anyone know the procedure for pick up/drop off at the NASCAR track? Will they let us in or do we have to drop folks off in the next county like at Arrowhead?
Kansas Speedway,JoeBuckYourself,3103175,207853,"I know when I dropped off at the speedway for the American Royal (which was not nearly as busy as it will be during race weekend), it was not organized, they just had me drop off right where they were taking money for parking. Our local Green Light hub really needs to get on the ball on setting up locations for these types of events."
Kansas Speedway,jfinks,3103714,207853,"The worst part about these drop offs is the amount of inflow traffic to the raceway. That is what is nice about drop offs at the stadiums, you have special access to the taxi lane. Due to the sheer amount of nascar fans headed to the track you really don't have a lot of options but to wait in the long lines. It is the same thing for drop offs at the former Sandstone theater that is now called Providence.I'm not sure Uber hub could do anything at the raceway, it would take closing a lane for taxi or ride share only and you would have to control miles of roadway to do this. You know those nascar people aren't gonna stay out of an empty lane of traffic."
Kansas Speedway,JT21491,3104747,207853,Sitting in a traffic jam for an hour at 11 cents a minute?.... I think I'll pass.
Kansas Speedway,jfinks,3105605,207853,Problem is you can get a ride to the track and have no choice but to wait in traffic. If you are picking up hopefully it is a heavy surge.
Kansas Speedway,bpsa1,3149032,207853,"Here's what I got from KS Speedway:You will follow the normal flow of traffic and tell the parking attendants you're dropping off and they will direct you to California Drive and you will drop your passengers off there.Picking up is an entirely different story and you will need to get here way before the race ends as Kansas Highway Patrol and KCKPD closes all roads for egress only and it's near impossible to get back into the facility until all traffic exits the facility. That being said, if you get here early enough you will park on California and your passengers will meet you there.Thanks,Kansas Speedway"
Kansas Speedway,jfinks,3149095,207853,"This is where Uber/Lyft should step in and negotiate with the KHP and KCKPD and allow the drivers into the venue. It is in Uber's/Lyft's best interest to do this as a lot will want a ride after especially since the race fans may have taken a ride share there in the first place.I will drop off at the Speedway, but no way would I ever bother to go there to pick up. First the race end is very unpredictable. That means you would have to get there about 1-2 hours before you think it will end. Thats a long drive in the first place, and 2 hours before, you could lose the opportunity to make 60+ in that time waiting. I would need a $100 guarantee for me to pickup at the race track. That is $50 for driving and waiting, and $50 guaranteed fare. It could be more if it is heavy surge and that is fine."
Kansas Speedway,jbudb,3153546,207853,"I wonder if it will be a good surge after the race. A decent XL ride with a 3x surge would be pretty good I would think. Of course If the Pax is going to the legends, it would be a total waste."

Kci queue number,KUBriguy,3006288,3006197,I have seen 82.
Kci queue number,jedofarc,3006293,3006288,"thats terrible, its also why I don't do airport pickups unless the line is less than 30."
Kci queue number,JoeBuckYourself,3006990,201365,"I have also noticed the Lyft queue being much longer than Uber. Last week Uber's queue was 23 and Lyft was 39, and I have seen similar numbers in the past. Are there really that many Lyft only drivers? I can't imagine you would stay very busy in KC only driving for Lyft. I always check flightstats to see how many flights are coming in, and use that along with the queue size to determine if I wait."
Kci queue number,jfinks,3118730,3006293,Sunday afternoon (around 3pm) I got to the airport after dropping off and the queue was 60. I was out of there with a ride in 40 minutes.
Kci queue number,UberRazor,3118760,201365,I posted this in a different thread last week. Yikes. It was a Wednesday
Kci queue number,jfinks,3118779,201365,"Nice, at that time of day you would be about 60 minutes waiting probably. 40 minutes is worth waiting. Not sure about 60min, it would probably depend on how much I had already driven that day. Sometimes it is nice to hang out at airport and relax for a while, especially when weather is nice. It isn't something I would drive specifically up to the airport to do unless I lived close. But if a ride took you to the airport I usually wait it out as long as there are lots of flights coming in."
Kci queue number,UberRazor,3118833,201365,Anybody up that way right now? What's the queue look like currently?
Kci queue number,jfinks,3118863,201365,Why don't ya tell us.
Kci queue number,UberRazor,3118899,3118863,If I were up there I'd share the info if someone asked but I'm not even close to that area. I'd assume the queue is fairly large on a Monday afternoon. Once in a great while I make a naked run up there if it's quiet elsewhere...
Kci queue number,KChitman,3119384,201365,The queue is 16 right now. I’ve been stuck at 10 for about 15 minutes.
Kci queue number,UberRazor,3127104,201365,"After driving on a FT basis over the past 7-10 days and multiple visits to the airport I decided to wait it out a few times with mid-range to high wait queue numbers (from 40-90) and I've found that each time It seems as though I can pretty much bank on one minute of wait time per queue number. Obv this wasn't in early morning (before 7am) or later than 11pm.So if I see an 80, I waited close to 80 minutes. Perfect example was this afternoon after a drop off (around 11 am) and queue was at 60 and sure enough, waited ~60 mins. Not sure if it's helpful or not but figured I'd pass it along to anyone interested in my findings. Keep safe out there!"
Kci queue number,jfinks,3127144,201365,Last Sunday afternoon it was about 40 minutes for every 60 cars. I am sure it varies a little. At least you know the range to expect. Now just gotta decide over time is it worth waiting 80 minutes or can you make more by heading back down town and taking 3-4 trips in that time. You only make about 25 bucks on a MCI to downtown trip.
Kci queue number,UberRazor,3127194,3127144,"Yup. That's the struggle. Kind of depends on my personal plans, etc. An hour wait is usually ok with me. But other people's time might be worth more to them."
Kci queue number,UberRazor,3145323,201365,"Here's a weird one - had a drop off this morning at airport and immediately hopped in the wait queue which was around 40, waited for about 30-40 mins and got a request and it was for a pickup at the freakin bus exchange area. Wtf. I didn't realize we were waiting for ppl who may work there or took a bus back to the bus area. I was annoyed to say the least but followed thru with the p/u and drop off of pax (9 min ride just north of MCI) and hopped back in queue...about right where I started near 40th in line. Anyone else come across this? Doesn't seem right as I thought it was for ""airport pickups"" only."

So accept the fact that there are ups and downs with any business. You can't expect all good things every time. Think who should be called to come and give ride to that person.

I guess my point was, if it wasn't clear, that I thought the queue was to be used solely for airport pickups at the terminals...apparently I was incorrect. I've accepted the fact that there's ups and downs but I appreciate the advice. I think I figured that out my second week on the road...believe me, I have no problem providing transportation to anyone, any ride is a good ride to me (except for UberEats, which I no-thank' twice today).Anyway, thanks for the insight everyone.

F'd up surge,randogg,3135999,210095,Anybody else gettin requests right in the middle of surge area that's not registering as surge pricing right now?
F'd up surge,deliverinkc,3136816,210095,Yes. I also have been in the surge several times this week and didn't even get a ride at all. I was literally sitting in Lenexa one day and the surge popped up on top of me and went for more than 10 mins and no ride. Just now I was at home and a surge for the speedway happened and I'm sitting right in it. I turned it on and drove towards the center. No ride at all! I was there until the surge went completely down and got no ride so I went home. I'm so annoyed with these fake surges.
F'd up surge,JT21491,3137850,210095,Uber may be hurting themselves with these fake surges. Thursday night I was sitting in the middle of a surge and got a request out of the surge and I turned it down. I sat there and waited until the surge went away and never did get a request in the surge area. Then they want to ***** about our acceptance rate.
F'd up surge,deliverinkc,3140121,210095,This is probably just some crackpot theory. I'm new to posting in the forums and I've posted about the airport queue and I've posted about the surges. Today at the airport I was given to rides while in the airport queue that were not at the airport and very short zona trips. I was just now sitting in the center of a surge and got a ride 18 minutes away in Shawnee and not at a surge fare. I had to wait a lot longer to get another ride. When that ride came in it was it a surge fair either. This is what my map looked like. Crazy theory...they watch the forums and punish those who speak out. Lol
F'd up surge,jedofarc,3141159,0,"I dunno, I tell people not to chase surges all the time and that they are for uber driver placement more than about the surge fares themselves. I think the surges a compound of historic rider data, passenger app pings and current spread of nearby drivers. It's super common for areas that don't see a lot of passengers to not have drivers near by, drivers aren't stupid (mostly lol). Lots of times surges can pop up for like 3x in a weird area, drivers race to it, but there really isn't any passenger traffic. Then as drivers fill in the surge dies and drivers hit the forums like what the ef? Just my experience at least"
F'd up surge,jfinks,3141208,210095,Belton/Raymore way south east surged 3x to 4x for over an hour last night. Anyone know what was going on down there?
F'd up surge,ScubaSteve2177,3141213,210095,Idk but last night was sooooo good for driving for me. 6 hours over $250
F'd up surge,randogg,3141275,210095,"Yeah, last night was lucrative. My original question was really just wondering if anyone was getting pings inside a surge area showing on my map but not registering the surge price on my end. Must have been a small glitch because after my first (ghost surge) trip, the app started correctly registering surge pricing again.Agree completely with jedo about surge chasing."
F'd up surge,deliverinkc,3145047,210095,I won't chase a surge but I do expect to get paid a surge fare if I'm sitting in the surge especially when I'm sitting in the surge and it's growing and I'm getting rides sent to me that aren't surge rates. That might was a great night for driving but I was still getting pings while in a surge area that weren't surge fares. Not cool
F'd up surge,jfinks,3145405,3145047,"Ya I was sitting at home Sat night in OP, my area surges quite a bit. There were two definite big surge areas, one in my area and southwest, then another cell North east, a small gap in the middle. I received (and ignored) 2 requests that were right in between, around 435 and Antioch. Finally after ignoring a few more I got a nice surge request that was worthy of me getting off my couch. Ended up taking them from 119th and Switzer to Power and Light, think it was a 2.5 surge or something like that."

Rider comments,aw99,3121842,209170,Don't worry about it. You do your best and these people write what they want. You can't do anything about it. Almost everyone gets professionalism complaints. They need you.
Rider comments,jfinks,3121899,3121842,"I go back and 1 or 2 star the last 10-20 rides when this happens, if I don't know who it was. Group punishment.I knew who one was and went back and one starred them. It was 1AM on a week night and I only gave one ride that night. The ride went ok and we had a nice conversation on the way. I know they 1 starred me because the day before I checked my stats and I didn't have any in the 1 star column. I went back and re rated and sent some rather harsh messages to Uber about the rating. Their note was for cleanliness also, my car wasn't squeaky clean and detailed, but it wasn't 1 star worthy at all. I can take a 4 star, but it was 1 am and you really can't see much wrong with a car at night.I don't worry about it, but revenge feels good.And I know a bad rating from a driver hurts a rider way more than a bad rating hurts a driver. The sheer number of rides that a driver does compared to rides a rider takes makes a bad rider rating sting quite a bit more. Most riders probably take 3-4 uber rides a week if that. On a normal week I give 30-40 rides and that is low compared to a full time driver."
Rider comments,KUBriguy,3124112,0,So to re-rate a rider Uber asks for a reason and feedback. is that not then shared with the rider and can't they go back and rate you lower?
Rider comments,aw99,3125117,209170,I don't think they will share that with the rider. Also the rider doesn't need to be notified unless he asks for it.

Wasn't even at the airport that day, took me 10 minutes to jump out of the queue, shutting down the app wouldn't do anything. Anyone had any weird glitches like that happen?"
Just driving down the highway and in airport queue,KUBriguy,3136304,3135962,Yep. Usually when I get south of Barry I am okay. the odd thing is that I might be in lot c and not yet in the queue. I mentioned this at the greenlight hub uber 201 class. the answer was that my GPS doesn't work. I mentioned it works the 100+ times I pick up riders. They suggested I uninstall and reinstall the app. Did that. It didn't fix it.
Just driving down the highway and in airport queue,deliverinkc,3136825,210092,The airport que is so glitchy sometimes and it's their service not our gps. There have been many times it waited a long time to put me in the que and sometimes I'm in at the gate and then it's kicked me off before. Several times one day to the point I left and went elsewhere for rides. Also it says you can go to the service station without losing your spot in line on their website. The one time I had to leave it kicked me out of the que the second I turned onto the road outside the gate. I've also had it move me further down in the line as I got closer to the gate and in the parking lot. It seems like moving my car causes me to lose my spot in line.

Have your tips gone up or down?,ScubaSteve2177,2965694,198617,"Mine were hit or miss before, but it's much more consistent now. I'd say I get about 10% of earnings average tips per night."

Fast forward to now, on fri and sat nights about half my riders tip, ironically mostly cash not in app, and during the week it's more like 20-25% of my riders.... how much they tip is really all over the place. I had a guy give me a $7 tip on a $4 fare last weekend, but then many airport rides i do there is no tip. When it comes to uber I just assume no tip and anything that comes is just extra. After all we don't do something skillful like, flip a lever on a tap to fill a glass full of beer."

I got $20 cash before but i think those ppl are still doing cash so doesnt matter.I think its because they have to go back n look to rate us & tip. If there was a prompt i think wed get more ratings n tips
Have your tips gone up or down?,UberRazor,3101973,198617,I've personally felt a dramatic increase in tips since the in-app feature was launched. Just did a quick scan starting from 9/16 and I've had 38 trips and 18 pax have tipped through the app. That's an astounding 47%; not to mention the few folks who tipped in cash so that pushes me well over the 50% mark in total amount of tips received. I'll take that!

Multiple stops,jbudb,3103218,207869,"Uber help says that the rider can request multiple stops by pressing the ""+ sign"" to the right of the ""where to"" block. My rider app has no such ""+ sign"". Can Pax change the destination after arriving, and before I end the trip? It seems that about a third of Pax want to make an additional st0p. I don't mind if it is not out of the way, but it often is a couple of miles and wait time to off load at the first stop. These folks rarely tip for the extra service. I had a pax get upset when I ended the trip at the first location and had her request a new trip."
Multiple stops,aw99,3103261,207869,As long as they are one group when I pick them up no matter how far I take them wherever they want to go. Few minutes you stop to unload part of the group is not a big deal. Still you're paid for the time and miles you drive.
Multiple stops,jfinks,3103694,3103218,"Don't worry about extra stops. They are extra trips that don't have additional booking fees. If it is out of the way try to accept a stacked trip if one pops up because uber a lot of times matches you with a rider close to your dropoff point. It might say 5 miles for that stacked trip, but when you drop off it might be a mile or less to pickup."
Multiple stops,jbudb,3126155,0,I was under the impression that the time and miles paid was based on the original destination no matter how many miles you actually drive or how long it takes.
Multiple stops,jfinks,3126181,3126155,"It kind of is, that is why it is always recommended to have the rider change the destination each time. Don't end the trip, just change at each drop off point. That way there is a record of each stop. Their fee should be recalculated for the longer distance. Good thing also is if it is a 2x surge that carries on to the next destination also. That is why it is important to not end the trip, you will lose the surge."
Multiple stops,jbudb,3126254,3126181,"That's what I started doing. Where I get trapped is when they say that they need to pick someone else up and it is ""right on the way"". I do some of those, but I usually get screwed."
Multiple stops,jfinks,3126265,207869,"I always ask how far out of the way it is, if it is on the way you really aren't losing out on anything, you will still get the mileage and time. It is when you go way out of the way to pick someone up that you need to have a record of the destination change. Otherwise Uber can come back and trim your mileage saying you took an inefficient route."
Multiple stops,jbudb,3129111,0,I've had rides trimmed due to inefficient route. I use WAZE and it seems to always use freeways if one is near. The UBER app tends to route me through residential streets with a stop sign on every block.
Multiple stops,KUBriguy,3132379,207869,How do you know when rides are trimmed? 90% of the time I see miles and minutes detailed on the fare details. the other 10% I just see a dollar amount for both without details on miles and minutes. is this What you are referring to?

Amazon Flex,Charles Wallace,3062018,205246,"Anyone try Amazon Flex? If so, where is the pickup location?"
Amazon Flex,JoeBuckYourself,3063068,205246,"I think it is new in our location, I looked into it a few weeks ago and it wasn't available. I just signed up, but need to do more research (and wait for background check) before I start. I also noticed that the available location was ""Kansas"" not Kansas City, so not sure if it is going to be limited in location. Would also like to hear from anyone delivering for Flex in this area."
Amazon Flex,SD42,3069913,205246,Ive been watching & waiting on this one too!
Amazon Flex,JoeBuckYourself,3069985,205246,The local Amazon Fulfillment Center is in Lenexa at 16851 W 113th S. I am guessing that this is where the pickup would be?
Amazon Flex,Charles Wallace,3072617,205246,"Alright gang, tried it out today. The pickup location is at K7 and 43rd street.... the boonies. I worked a 4 hour ""block"" in Tonganoxie that started out smooth. After about 7 deliveries my route turned into nothing but dirt/rock roads and stayed that way for about two hours. It was awful.... poor luck most likely but it was an absolute pain. Also, out in the country dogs just kond of roam wherever, had to deal with dogs that weren't too happy to see me...At least passengers don't try to bite. Trying again tomorrow."
Amazon Flex,JoeBuckYourself,3073035,205246,Thanks for the info. Yeah that is way to far away for me to consider doing it. Was hoping it was Lenexa.Did you get the notification of where the delivery area would be before you started?
Amazon Flex,JT21491,3088952,205246,"What did it pay you if you don't mind me asking. And, did you make more in that 4 hour block than you would have hauling people?"
Amazon Flex,JoeBuckYourself,3101896,205246,"Did my first Flex haul today. The warehouse is a little chaotic but it is new, and many of the drivers are new, so it will hopefully get better. FYI, there are 3.5 hour blocks available on the app, but the service center only does 3, 4 and 5 hour blocks. They had me take out some packages from a 4 hour block to make it equivalent to a 3.5. It took me extra time to remove these, and it seemed to me there was less than 12.5% of the total amount removed (which is how much would need to be removed to make 4 = 3.5), so I may have got slightly screwed. They are supposed to fix the app to not allow 3.5 hour blocks in our marked.To answer JT21491, I would think you could make more per hour than Ubering during slow weekdays, but you have to hustle to make it worth it. Also, I drive a standard sized SUV, I imagine it would be difficult with a sedan."
Amazon Flex,deliverinkc,3119467,205246,"After reading a lot of bad reviews online about Amazon Flex I went ahead and tried it with caution expecting the reviews to be right because they were all about the same across the board. They were right. My experience was the same as Charles. The same route everything the same except the dogs were really friendly to me and I had to return two packages to the warehouse because they were undeliverable. The route took longer than it said it would and took a lot of gas. I've seen the rate jump to $25 an hour. I could see it being worth that at that rate with as long as it took and as much gas as it took. It's possible I'll do it again for the higher rates because those do come along often enough. Plus I live close to the new facility and hoping they get Amazon Flex going there. I've also heard that even though you take a photo of the package if you have to leave it at the door, a customer can say they didn't get it you're responsible. Amazon doesn't investigate or look into your photo."
Amazon Flex,aw99,3125155,205246,Last night in my neighborhood around 6:30 pm I saw a guy with a phone with his one hand removing small packages from his trunk. I believe he was Amazon flex guy. His trunk was full of small packages. What happens if he has to deliver big boxes? If I am not mistaken his car was Honda Accord. I wished him good luck from far.
Amazon Flex,JoeBuckYourself,3129619,205246,"Yes I am not sure how people are doing this in mid size cars. It depends on the block you get, I've done 4 hour blocks that are mostly small packages and envelopes, and 3.5 hour blocks that are almost all boxes that completely fill up my SUV. It's a matter of luck. Also, routes with a lot of apartments extremely slow you down, where possible I just go to the leasing office and have them sign for them."

Uber eats,Evette,3119509,3072503,"I did it for the first time yesterday. It isn't worth it AT ALL!!! I picked up from a restaurant in downtown KC and as you know, I had to find somewhere to park. I got to the restaurant and the order wasn't ready so I waited about 10 minutes. Walked back to my car, and delivered the food in midtown. All for a measly $5.00. No tip...no extra money for the wait time...nothing. I'm NEVER accepting an UBER EATS delivery again. What a F'n RIP OFF!EXACTLY=!!"

Uber eats,UberRazor,3120505,3120433,"It wasn't too far for the eats p/u - I just fear the hassle of waiting on food and delivering it 5 mins away for peanuts.

Uber eats,jfinks,3121829,3120505,"Did you get a food bag from Uber? I signed up for it and they said they would send one, but I haven't seen it."
Uber eats,UberRazor,3123673,0,I watched the intro video and it mentioned the eats bag but I didn't look into it. Maybe I should and just keep it in the trunk? That's all I need is more clutter back there...to sit w/ my grocery bags and emergency car-care kit.Prob get a 1 star from a pax who would rate my trunk...thatd be my luck!
Uber eats,aw99,3125187,205725,Anybody tried postmates? It is the same thing like UberEats but not only food you could also order anything. Tried it when it started here in KC area. Not good. After few tries I just stopped doing it. I thought I was going to make $20/hr. It was a hassle finding parking and people to deliver to. One time a college student ordered double cheeseburger and fries from McDonald's. I don't have yo tell you she didn't tip.

"Wednesday, how is it going out there?",jfinks,3100137,207665,I am great while sitting here searching for riders that said they were gonna tip and never did. lol Change rating to 2.
"Wednesday, how is it going out there?",arghcd,3100206,207665,I honestly have never rated any passenger less than a 5 more than 10-12 times after 2300 rides. I had a couple that smelled so badly or were just plain dicks. Excuse my ignorance on this particular thing. But can pax see what we rated them at any time after a ride?
"Wednesday, how is it going out there?",jfinks,3100342,207665,No they can't see directly but their rating will go down if less than 5stars. That is why I wait 3-4 days or more to rerate. My hopes is in that time they might have taken another ride or 2 so they won't know who did it. Less than half of the riders rate drivers in the first place.Generally I will only re-rate down to 2-3 stars if they said they would tip and never did. Or there is one time I had a perfectly ok ride and it was the only ride I gave for the last couple of days and my rating tanked. Went down from like 4.83 to 4.77 and I had a 1 star show up and I didn't have any prior. I rerated that axxhole back to 1 and gave uber a piece of my mind several times.
"Wednesday, how is it going out there?",arghcd,3100377,207665,"I have 2% 1 stars after a ton of rides, and a 4.85 rating. I have never been rated a 2 or 3 so I know pax are just being fu#$*rs.

"Wednesday, how is it going out there?",jfinks,3100515,207665,"Ya I have 1% 1 star and 2% 3 star. I think an old 1 star dropped off recently, but still have a ways to go for that other one to drop.

"Wednesday, how is it going out there?",aw99,3103105,3100036,Last winter I got a request from Walmart. Immediately the young girl called me and instructed me to park and wait for her. I didn't like that but I was patient and waited for her for about 7 minutes without starting the trip. Finally she came out with a lot of bags and put it all over my back sit. I got out of my car and offered to help her. She said nothing. The trip was a short 5 minutes drive. That already made me unhappy. When we got at her apartment she wanted me to get up her driveway which was very steep. I said that would hit my bumper. She rated me bad for not being professional. I wrote back to Uber what type of professional service am I suppose to provide for a $3 trip and gave her 2 stars.We are freeloaders.
"Wednesday, how is it going out there?",jfinks,3103663,3103105,Sad thing is Uber made more than you on that trip.
"Wednesday, how is it going out there?",aw99,3104088,207665,Yeah...That's one of the things what upset drivers. The short trips are very unfair. At least on those trips Uber should lower its cut. When you add the booking fee Uber takes sometimes about 50%.
"Wednesday, how is it going out there?",jfinks,3104110,207665,At least they could bill half the booking fee to the rider on a short trip.
"Wednesday, how is it going out there?",JT21491,3104681,3100342,Can the PAX go back and change the rating of the driver?
"Wednesday, how is it going out there?",jfinks,3105632,207665,"Only about a third rate at all. They can rate weeks after, but not sure if they can change after rating."

Turned app on and drove 103rd street east to State line. Got a ping for BELTON when I was at 435 and state line, ""No Thanks'd"" that one. I drove to 135 and back into south OP, got a short trip to College and 69.Second long pickup, clear up by Speedway, wow. 20minutes? nope. Took a couple trips after that and called it quits.Uber really needs to wake up and figure out a way to compensate for long pickups. These are paying customers, just need to guarantee it is worthwhile for a driver to venture out that far."
Long pickups Tuesday night.,jedofarc,2954682,197959,"I think its potentially a technical issue as well. I've as of recently been getting pings that were 20 mins plus and when I peak at the passenger app there are plenty 'o' drivers in-between us and them... Last weekend I was down around 75th and Nall and got one for near the financial district. I looked at passenger app, there were 6 cars within maybe 2-3 miles of me and I have a hard time believing there were none in the plaza, Financial District or P and L or WP? All places that should ping up before it came to me..."
Long pickups Tuesday night.,jfinks,2954750,197959,"Ya I don't know, it is dumb. I never look at the pax app. Those cars you see may already have riders also, at least some of them."
Long pickups Tuesday night.,jedofarc,2954752,197959,"000o0o0oo00o, really? For some reason in my head if they had a rider they fell off the pax app till they were free again. Okay fair enough maybe then it WAS really busy lol."
Long pickups Tuesday night.,jfinks,2954759,197959,"I don't think they disappear, but I haven't looked and tested for a while. I know in the past that I have seen a pickup and was able to watch where they went."
Long pickups Tuesday night.,KUBriguy,2957556,197959,Maybe they are pinging the higher rates drivers or drivers with higher acceptance rates. 180 days not withstanding.
Long pickups Tuesday night.,jedofarc,2959665,0,I sure hope not because my acceptance rate is about to plummet then... No way I accept a ride with a 16 min ride to pickup...
Long pickups Tuesday night.,jfinks,2959684,197959,"It definitely isn't about Acceptance rates. Mine hovers around 25% when I am being picky. If things are going well it gets to about 50%.I suppose that night there were no drivers between me and Belton, so I was probably the closest. But, not knowing how long the trip is after pickup I'm not going that far. Coulda been someone going to Walmart a mile away."
Long pickups Tuesday night.,NGOwner,2960105,197959,"Really, jfinks? Your acceptance rates regularly range between 25%? and 50%? I'm really surprised because KC isn't a big enough Uber market to ignore 50 - 75% of ride requests. Which is effectively what you are doing.My accept rate has always been 90+% on Uber. The only pings I ignore are those more than ~10 minutes away. And thankfully long pickups are few and far between. It's different for Lyft, those pickup distances are sometimes ridiculous. And I really want to ignore those pax with low ratings, but there just aren't enough pings, stacked or otherwise, during the day to take the risk of even more downtime.[NG]Owner"
Long pickups Tuesday night.,jedofarc,2960132,2960105,"For me, Uber is a side job, one that I for the most part like... I too am pretty picky... my acceptance rate doesn't drop that low typically... although it has when I spent a day getting 15+min away pings because no on a Friday night I'm not going to drive from lea wood area to plaza to pick someone up and then likely drop them off in Westport or crossroads 5 mins away. That being said honestly, passing on someone who's a 4.1 rating is an easy choice for me, I don't need more headaches than its worth... the few times Ive picked up sub 4.5 rated passengers they sucked pretty hard and I realized very quickly why they were sub 4.5 i.e. one guy who threatened to call the cops because I wouldn't let him drink his beer in my car.I totally get it though if you're trying to do this full time or really just maximize your dollars per time you gotta roll with what comes your way. NG do you drive around in-between rides? I tend to if its nice out and I just want to drive a bit but most times I just find my favorite well located lots/businesses and park and wait. It can be slow during the week for sure."
Long pickups Tuesday night.,NGOwner,2960229,197959,"No, no driving between rides. I'm a drop off, and find a shady place to park kind of guy. If after 10 minutes I don't get a ping, I begin to drive towards areas where I think I might get one: areas that have the unicorn combination of population density, income, and lack of ants.And no, I'm not doing this full time either. But when I'm out, I do want to maximize to the extent possible the revenue I can generate. That's why the only real ""reject"" criteria I have is distance/time to pickup.[NG]Owner"
Long pickups Tuesday night.,jedofarc,2960254,2960229,"So I think than in some ways I'm more similar to you, my rej rate is usually above 80%. I have a few more reject triggers though... On weeknights riders who are sub 4.5 and on weekends/fridays riders who are sub 4.6 (I can be a little pickier since volume is higher). I also have gotten away from WP Fri/Sat pickups after 10pm which I know sounds silly because well.. money, but WP on Fri and Sat Nights unless I can see that they are already waiting in a parking lot or not in the heart of WP I'll do my drop offs, log off and log back on once I'm out of the immediate area. I wish we'd get an Uber lane or something down in WP."
Long pickups Tuesday night.,jfinks,2960307,197959,"I get a bunch of stacked pings and I rarely accept those because very little info is given on location. Sometimes I have the app on and run into the store and bam wouldn't you know it get some pings. Then there are the stupid long pickups that are just dumb. On a busy night I get it to about 60% and that is about average for me. I get silly stacked pings right after picking up a rider, and it is for the same location that I am picking up. I don't accept because usually they get cancelled anyway. I don't usually accept 5.o pax especially in shady parts of town.Ya the Uber KC greenlight or whoever manages the KC market are slackers. We don't even get concert notifications for the Sprint Center and I haven't seen other areas marked recently either. Ztrip has taken over the Sprint center with there big balloon tent, not sure who they blew to get that done but I bet they paid somebody off."

Who waits that long? Drove towards NKC. Got a ping from Briarcliff out to Arrowhead. Had 15 deadmiles to get it, but had a ping in 15 minutes.Let the lemmings wait....[NG]Owner"
Long pickups Tuesday night.,jfinks,2964159,197959,"Ya that is the key at airport, deciding to wait or make other income during that time. There is also no guarantee that waiting that long at the airport will give a large fare. Downtown or Plaza is common and that is $15-20 or so. Wait over an hour I guarantee I can make more than that doing 2-3 trips.It is also where you are at in your driving day. If you have been out a long time already it can be nice to kick back and relax for an hour or 2 in the lot. Grab some snacks at the gas station and watch planes land. Lot C is right in line with Runway 19L so is fun seeing planes fly overhead."

Long pickups Tuesday night.,JoeBuckYourself,2991747,197959,"I agree, it would be nice if the KC green light Hubs actually did something. With all of the events last weekend you would think they would have established guidelines for pickup locations (American Royal, Irish Fest) in addition to the normal spots that are an issue. Even if they don't care about the drivers, this would help the experience of the Pax and thus increase revenue."
Long pickups Tuesday night.,jfinks,2991897,2991747,"I don't know if that is their job to add events to the app. I know one weekend they setup a pizza party at like 2am for drivers.

I've only had one time that I actually had to eat the mileage. Typically, depending on the time, I get into a flow that's offered, and eventually I end up in/near Downtown KC on Friday and Saturday nights. Longer trips usually do well on tips too. I've gotten three $20 tips, and a few $10, and I'd estimate some kind of tip about 70-80% of the time, for my time/trouble. The riders know it's out of the way and are usually pretty pleased that I respond. That said, I don't mind ranging out to wherever to see where it takes me."

I waited about 30 minutes and got a ride to Lawrence.That 94 may look bad but I bet the actual cars in front of you would be about 50-60 which at that time in day would be about an hour or so wait.The nice thing about the Lot C queue is now it gives an exact position number instead of 10-20, 20-30, 30-40. This must be a recent change. If you are up at the airport it is worth it to head over to Lot C and actually get in the request queue, it is different than the cars at airport number."

Do you tell him you're a driver too? I did. I can't believe his rating is 4.96 after 3000 trips in 2 years. His car is at least 10 years old. Clean inside but it needs car wash for the exterior.
Just requested Uber,jfinks,3104139,207922,"Ya, I mentioned taking 5-6 ubers last week. All but one I mentioned I drove also. The one I didn't tell wasn't very fluent in English so I didn't want to go there... lol He had enough trouble figuring out right from left.Generally the other driver asks normal questions about how much you drive and when. One driver had be at it for about three weeks and asked for advice on a 120 mile trip he had , one way. He felt he should have gotten a tip or return trip fee, but all totaled he still made $26 per hour on the trip including gas costs. One guy was just starting out with his wife driving. They were going to tag team with one car. He drives for 6-8 hours per day then she would go out driving for about half that. I think they were going to see if they could make a go of it and save on child care costs."
Just requested Uber,aw99,3104209,207922,The only time I have a chance to talk to a driver is when I am a rider. We all are busy. There is little interest to talk to a driver parked next to me who is staring on his phone screen. In my case we talked about Lyft and Uber. He said he opens both apps but he prefers Uber. Because he gets more requests. It's strange but he said the airport waiting time is about 1 hour even with 90 people ahead of you. I thought it could be longer than that.
Just requested Uber,jfinks,3104382,207922,"It can be longer than that, depends on time of day though. Think about half those 90 might be on Uber and Lyft and are going to take the first request that comes. 20 or more might give up in that time and head out with no rider."

Full time vs Pat time,UberRazor,3102002,207773,"Well, I'm officially a full time driver as of last Friday after getting let go from my day job. Bummer. Large international company chopping heads (i was a contractor) heading into Q4 of a horrid earnings year for the company. I guess they are trying to help the bottom line...oh well. On to the next adventure!This begged the question though - unemployment or Uber full time. Max unemployment is $474/week (in KS) and figured I can easily make that driving per week. Anyone else go through this? Obviously I'm not even close to making what I did for my day job but it'll hold me over until I find my next gig so any money is good money ATM.Yawl drive FT or PT? I used to do it only when the ol lady traveled for work to make a few extra bucks for my personal spending on golf, travel, Christmas, etc. But now it's full on grind time!!Wish me luck!"
Full time vs Pat time,jedofarc,3102105,207773,"Sorry to hear that sucks,Forgive my ignorance but is the 474 before or after taxes? If it’s after I’d take the 474 and use the free time to get some IT certifications or something like that while you’re finding your next thing. If the 474 is before taxes you might be better off on the uber trails.While I have and will continue to defend uber as a decent fri and sat night gig part time (which is what I do) at full time you’re starting to seriously tax your car in terms of wear and tear. The rider volume also is substantially lower during the week (at least at night maybe good in the mornings? I’ve not tried it). While it’s pretty easy to do $200+ between a fri and sat I think you’ll struggle a bit harder sun-thurs (especially without royals games and only every other week home chiefs games). Just my take and I’ve never tried to go full time, so maybe some FTers on here will say otherwise.Also other factor would be how do you feel about driving? For me I enjoy (most of the times at least) the conversations and people. But if you aren’t into that 40+ hours a week might get old fast."
Full time vs Pat time,UberRazor,3103305,3102105,"Thank for the condolences. Haha.The 474 is pre-tax, FYI. I am using Tuesday as my Saturday because I've found that is the slowest day and night of the week. I prefer early mornings with mostly airport runs and hauls to work, etc. As for your other question, I really enjoy the driving aspect of it...talking to passengers, the freedom, etc. The key is to optimize fuel usage and your time efficiently (as we all know)....if I can drive in the neighborhood of 30-35 hours (I don't think I'll burn out) and meet a $20-$25 per hour rate, I'll be good with that."
Full time vs Pat time,jfinks,3103630,207773,"The good thing is going into the holidays is typically busier. Lots of people last year going to and from holiday parties for work or with friends. People are less and less willing to risk driving after having a few drinks.I still have never figured out why they tax unemployment benefits. Just plain stupid. The answer is because they can of course.People bag on Uber all the time, but it sure is nice to know that you can fall back on it at any time. It makes for much less stress. Typically in my work we have slow periods and we are in one now. I take time off work, kind of like a voluntary furlough, and just uber a little more to make up the difference."
Full time vs Pat time,NGOwner,3103909,207773,"Driving UberX, in September, I drove ~60 hours and averaged ~$20.50 per hour before costs.Tips have pushed the hourly values up 25%.

UberSelect,,205911,0,
UberSelect,KUBriguy,3072669,205911,"I haven't had a single Uberselect trip the past 3 months, just Uberx. Any Uberselect drivers out there? Do you find the same thing?"
UberSelect,jfinks,3074575,205911,"I took an uber ride the other day, it was a select capable car, but I ordered X. I talked to the Driver a bit after mentioning I drove uber also. He said he might get 1 select ride per day. It is very rare. Really I think they should just do away with Select (in KC market at least) and have uber X, Uber XL and Uber Black.The select ride I took a couple weeks ago cost about $16 and it wasn't any special car. It just had leather seats, big deal, It was a tiny little Lexus CT hatchback. I took the select uber just to see what the service was like. Really it is not much different or better than a lot of X cars. I don't think many people in KC, even semi wealthy businessmen/lawyers, really care about a luxury 4 mile, 5 mile or even 10-20 mile ride on normal occasions."
UberSelect,KUBriguy,3074599,3074575,Thanks for the info! Not very promising for that market. Maybe Kauffman Performing Arts or Plaza on a Friday or Saturday night might be better.
UberSelect,jfinks,3074644,205911,"It has good intentions. See that that is the thing, you mention Friday/Sat night where there is heavy demand and probably high surge. Select is gonna be way more than X at that point. Say a normal X ride is $10, 3X surge that it is $30. The same non surge Select ride is $20, now that becomes $60. If a rider normally would pay $10 on a non surge X that means they are going about 4-5 miles max. 3x surge the same select ride and now the rider is paying $12-$15 per mile, approximately. It just isn't competitive anymore and a rider would rather call a limo or something."
UberSelect,NGOwner,3075765,205911,"I don't think that the surges are equal among all rides. X, XL and Select all have their own individual surges. So when it does surge, riders should look to other vehicle types to compare rates.[NG]Owner"
UberSelect,jfinks,3075794,205911,That kinda sucks if true. That means a surged X ride might cost more than a Select.
UberSelect,aw99,3076500,205911,"I think if you drive only select you’re always disadvantaged in our market. Weekdays, it is slow very few select riders. On weekends you could make more on X if it surges."
UberSelect,KUBriguy,3077929,205911,I left select only on all day downtown just to see. No pings. I noticed a Lexus CT is not on the select list in KC but I have heard of other vehicles not on the list still able to funcrion as select.
UberSelect,jfinks,3077941,205911,I think if it sounds expensive and has leather seats it is in.
UberSelect,UberRazor,3101942,205911,"Well crap, maybe I can get my 2013 accord exl added to the select list then (all leather, heated front seats, the works). It receives compliments all of the time. Hmmm"
UberSelect,aw99,3102962,0,"Honestly your vehicle choice is the wrong one for UberX or any other class. You may be bought it for yourself. To use it for UberX it is expensive for you. You and a 2002 Honda civic driver get paid the same. If I order SELECT and you show up with Honda Accord I would not be happy. I expect Lexus, or Cadillac. I don't think Honda could be listed under SELECT."
UberSelect,jbudb,3102982,205911,Would really like to see uber black in KC. My Tahoe LTZ is XL but I have to accept uber x or sit a very long time when it is a non-surge area.
UberSelect,aw99,3103005,205911,The problem is the demand for it. Do you think enough people will request black for you to be busy? It would be rough to drive Uber X with your Tahoe. I am sorry for you. People are not happy even with Prius.
UberSelect,jbudb,3103172,205911,"I get a substantial amount of X riders who have four people and luggage. I wonder what the true X cars do with these folks. At least with Black, they would be requesting a SUV. Not sure about it, but I think it would help."
UberSelect,JoeBuckYourself,3103217,205911,"I have a recent model Honda Pilot that is decked out (leather, sunroof, heated seats) but I was told it is not select in our market. So I don't think a Honda or Toyota can be select in KC no matter how nice they are. Needs to have the fancier emblem (Lexus, Acura, etc.)."
UberSelect,UberRazor,3103271,3102962,"I understand the part about not being happy if I rolled up in my accord and you ordered a select...but I'd put my interior/space/smooth ride up against a Lexus hatchback that someone had mentioned previously. Regardless, I know folks would be upset too.As for the accord ""being expensive for me,"" I'm not really sure what you mean? Explain it further. How do you if it's expensive for me or not? Perhaps our definitations of expensive are different. I certainly know you're not speaking of the MPG, as I usually haul right around 35 mpg on the daily."
UberSelect,aw99,3103388,3103271,"I am not saying your car is not nice. It is.Your car could be worth $18, 000 right now. I could buy a little bit older car for $8,000 and make the same amount of money like you do. After four years we both would put 100, 000 miles each on our cars Both our cars would worth nothing by that time. Now you lost $10, 000. That's why it is expensive for you."

Rideshare insurance,,148508,0,
Rideshare insurance,KC_Ride,2215313,148508,Honestly. Any body knows how the regular insurance work with uber?I'm not sure if we are covered with our own insurance policy in case of an accident when driving for uber.
Rideshare insurance,Chad Smith,2218941,148508,"do some googling. uber's insurance will disown you unless something happens with a passenger in the car. rideshare policies cover your risk when you have the app on with no passenger, and on your way to a passenger."
Rideshare insurance,louvit,2290456,148508,"this is on the uber page, I read it as we are insured by uber as soon as we click online....https://newsroom.uber.com/insurance-for-uberx-with-ridesharing/"
Rideshare insurance,DKJ,2292440,148508,"Uber claims to cover you if you are online, who knows if they actually will. You have to carry regular insurance for Uber to cover you. And they say they will cover you for collision if you carry comprhensive on your personal insurance.Your personal insurance will not cover you while app is turned on unless you buy extra coverage."
Rideshare insurance,tmart,2498940,2215313,"Gotta have rideshare ins to be 'officially' covered by Geico if you app is even ON. Yes app even on, or you risk not being covered even if you have no passengers during a fender bender. I have a newer ford focus (car loan - yes) and my geico insurance rates went down a few bucks when i switched over. You will actually be switching to geico commercial insurance. My deductible also remained the same."
Rideshare insurance,louvit,2506699,0,I was told they do not offer rideshare ins. in Florida... is commerical different than rideshare?
Rideshare insurance,tmart,2506795,2506699,"With geico, rideshare coverage is only available via a commerical policy (at least here in KS), they actually cancelled my standard policy and converted me to commerical. My rates went down a couple of bucks also. After researching this issue i discovered rideshare options vary from state to state. If you want to know for sure - contact your current insurance provider and ask them if you're covered if the app is even ON, or you have a passenger (either or scenario), Let them know your thinking about driving for uber, and you want to check this out. Ive heard of people being cancelled by their insurance companies and denying claims if they find out someone was uber-driving without the proper coverage. Just advice here - but dont risk it, if someone is injured or you totally jack your car you risk no coverage (or denied) even if the app is on. (Ive also heard ins companies can request uber on/off app records also if they want to)."
Rideshare insurance,louvit,2506817,2506795,When I first started driving I did call Geico and say I am thinking of doing uber and they said that they do not insure it. That was 5-6 months ago. I wounder if this new law will change anything. If not I have no choice to quit.
Rideshare insurance,tmart,2506830,148508,"Here in KS they recently started to offer it, not sure about other states though. Best to call geico or progressive to find out for sure, as state laws may change from time to time."
Rideshare insurance,louvit,2506900,2506830,I am afraid to call Geico again..but.....I just got a quote from Formost which is the only one in Fl that offers it. I pay 140.00 a month now with FULL coverage like 100-300k and all. Formost wants a downpayment of 334.00 and 341.00 a month...More than double. I only work P/T so that is not an option

Rideshare insurance,JoeBuckYourself,3018464,148508,"I added it to my existing Farmers policy, increased $35 a month. It's apparently good for both of my cars, even though I only use one part time for ride sharing. From what my agent told me, this is needed for when you are logged onto Uber/Lyft but don't have a rider. Not sure how they could prove you weren't just driving privately, but I didn't want to risk it."
Rideshare insurance,Richard Miller,3078558,2506699,"I use Shelter Insurance (out of Columbia, MO). My agent stated they do not offer Rideshare insurance. I voluntarily increased my coverage considerably however (peace of mind thing). We talked about ""phases"" that are covered -- Phases 1 and 2 are good to go with Shelter, but Uber Commercial Insurance must take Phase 3 (you are actively transporting the rider). Fortunately Shelter did not demand any additional premiums because I'm driving Uber. It wouldn't matter if I was part-time or full-time to them either. I've been with Shelter for about 18 years, and they've been pretty good to work with. Qualitatively they do well, and I've never felt screwed over by them. I imagine if you ask for a quote, it'll be cheaper than the other companies because they haven't decided to force a Rideshare policy on anyone at this point.My agent from Shelter explained that if I was going to drive with Uber/Lyft, I would need a commercial insurance plan to cover Phase 3 (transporting the rider), when I was driving. Rideshare plans apparently boost insurance coverage in a broad manner, and it seems like a scam to me. As long as you're okay with the commercial insurance Uber offers, then you're good with your own policy covering Phases 1 and 2 -- depending on which company you are with. If you want something different, you can use your own policy if you choose to, and make any claims on it as you wish. However, commercial plans are pricey."
Rideshare insurance,NGOwner,3079665,148508,"I thought I would put another $0.02 in this thread. My insurance is cycling on the 7th of October and I'm adding another driver to my account (my 16 year old son). Four vehicles, two at liability only, two with full coverage (one of these listed as a rideshare vehicle). Four drivers, three males, no tickets, no accidents, no driving blemishes of any kind for any of the four of us. 250K/500K Liability. 100K Property. 25K/50K Un/Under Insured. No rental. No towing.I requested quotes from all but one of the insurance firms offering rideshare coverage in KS: Geico, Farmers, Allstate (my current carrier), American Family and State Farm (didn't go to Safeco, they were ridiculously high last time I checked).Without bundling homeowners (I have NEVER been able to get a better combined cost for Homeowners + Auto from a single carrier than I can get by farming each out individually) these are the rates I received back for payment in full for a six month period:Allstate: $1120.19 (requires 16 year old to be named on the policy)Farmers: $1656.00 (didn't require 16 year old to be named yet)American Family: $1147.60 (Bundled rate with homeowners, homeowners policy too expensive in comparison)State Farm: $1333.53 (didn't require 16 year old to be named yet)Geico: $1388.08Geico was a strange animal. It required multiple policies (personal and commercial). Drivers under 21 are prohibited from driving rideshare car. The rideshare policy requires payment in full for a 12 month period.So there you have it. Mike Tiffany is my Allstate guy. He's good.[NG]Owner"

PAX claimed he could not reset the location and received a server error on his app. Third one called, cancelled and resubmitted request with the correct address.

How's Lyft?,KUBriguy,3034374,3030629,"Only given 1 lyft ride. not much demand for the times I drive, 4p-8p."
How's Lyft?,NGOwner,3035857,203094,"It's usually a 8-10:1 request ratio Uber to Lyft in KC. Lately its been trending to more demand for Lyft. I think Lyft is running ridership campaigns which likely accounts for the uptick.Weekday evenings (if I get out), I run both apps to maximize potential. Weekend afternoons/evenings/nights I'm usually busy enough with Uber that the Lyft app hardly ever gets turned on.[NG]Owner"
Airport Unicorn,,202987,0,
Airport Unicorn,jfinks,3028987,202987,"So last night, or guess Sunday early am. Pouring down rain I decided to take a trip, 3.1 surge and 12 minutes away. I usually don't go that far, but for a 3.1 I will. Pull up and I see suitcases, a lot of times means airport. Yep, start trip, airport run at 3am from south of plaza area. Floated up there going through some big puddles. These Californians said they've never seen lightning, and not this much rain. lolI didn't wait at the airport but got a request heading back on Tiffany Springs. Another guy going to airport, no surge. There were more after this but I was hungry and needed gas so I ignored several trips all the way to OP. I might have taken a good surge trip, but none came up even though KC was surging in parts.Guess this makes up for me going to Liberty earlier, light surge so I took it. I got there in 15 min. The idiot put his destination address as the pickup. He called and said he didn't know what happened, software must have messed up, said he was a couple minutes away. I waited it out and cancelled no show. Homie don't play that after driving that far. Liberty can suck it..."
Airport Unicorn,KUBriguy,3030130,202987,That is way early for a flight. guess they never flew out of KC before.
Airport Unicorn,jfinks,3030242,202987,"Ya a little early but understandable. They were tired and wanted to nap for a bit but were afraid they might not get up in time and still find a driver. Weather was crap and they said 2 other drivers canceled already.I didn't drop them off until 3:40 am, think flight was at 6am.$87 trip trip for them."

The issue you have is not where you have to drive. It seemes like there are more drivers than riders. Don't get frustrated get used to it.Click to expand...Yup at times it seems like there are on weekdays. But at closing times things pickup. I don't even drive after work anymore. I wait until late evening to go out or after midnight on weekdays."
"getting frustrated, the beginning of the week, seems to be so slow",arghcd,3010569,201523,"It's not worth doing this anymore to be honest, there are so many drivers out here it's not even funny. Surge is absolutely manipulated to get us where uber wants us. I can't remember the last surge over 1.4 that I got paid for. We are all insane, it's literally modern day slave wage..."
"getting frustrated, the beginning of the week, seems to be so slow",jfinks,3010688,3010569,"As a full time thing it would be rough. I average about 20/hr when I am out. Every driver needs to be very choosy on what pickups they do. I rarely go more than 2-3 miles or 8 minutes for a regular fare. I sometimes go further if I am on the way already, but that is rare. Every driver needs to adopt these rules. It will help drive down the supply of drivers. If every rider gets a long pickup for free then it will always be expected. Just don't do it. Remember you don't work for Uber."
"getting frustrated, the beginning of the week, seems to be so slow",jedofarc,3011423,3010688,"Agreed. When I first started doing this I assumed it was more work equals more money and it just doesn't work that way. Not wasting gas driving around without a fare (includes going to a fare and also just waiting for a ping), picking when you work, and where all go a long ways. After a month or two I learned that often I don't really always get to drive where I want I just learned where to go, what kinds of rides to pass on, etc. Following and learning the basic principles makes $16 after gas etc very doable."
"getting frustrated, the beginning of the week, seems to be so slow",aw99,3012066,0,We have done this for long time and I don't think making $20/hr is a correct assessment. If that is the case everyone should be happy. Why are people frustrated??
"getting frustrated, the beginning of the week, seems to be so slow",jfinks,3013060,201523,"It is if you only drive high demand times. Fri/Sat night. But ya trying to do it full time, probably not in X. If you could get steady rides in Select it could be way more. Like I said in previous post, be very selective. Last sat night about 1:45AM I passed on about 10 rides to an area that should be surging, 119th and Metcalf. That area should surge at 3x, I didn't take any rides, just ignored them all, I was 2 miles away waiting in an apt complex that I dropped off at. Lots of drunks at 1:45 - 2am on the Ks side, I don't accept anything less than a 2x."
"getting frustrated, the beginning of the week, seems to be so slow",aw99,3013160,0,High demand times are very few hours a week maybe only Friday and Saturday nights. If you want to work just those hours it is not enough. You can't average $20 with so many drivers even on weekends. We are talking ahout overall people are not happy with how Much they make.That's right. The best way to put is...It is not fun anymore. It is not worth it unless you have no other choice and you have to do this.
"getting frustrated, the beginning of the week, seems to be so slow",jedofarc,3013931,3013160,"So, should have mentioned that too, not sure how many hours a week everyone on here is trying to put on, but if you're not steady from like 6pm- 2am Fri and Sat, you should probably consider adjusting where you are driving. Very very rare that I don't run near $20 before gas on these times... thats like a 16 hour window. Most nights I don't even stay out that late because, well lets be honest sometimes its kind of a hassle with the early morning crowd. Even if you're not in a surge during these times I still run $15+ during these times. To be fair I have mostly given up on weekdays as yes, during these times its pretty bad. So if you are trying to find 25 or more hours a week, its just probably not in the cards. But if you're willing to tolerate the fri-sat night, the money is still there."
"getting frustrated, the beginning of the week, seems to be so slow",aw99,3014005,201523,"I don't know. It looks like you're just reading the weekly total hours calculated by Uber. You have to double that time. Don't forget to count the pick up time and miles. Also, when you say $15 or $20 you need to explain that is before all the expenses. Average per hour income is no more than $10. I am not a new driver. Using my own car, cleaning my car, using my gas, my time, not to mention insurance and accidents. It is not enough however you sugarcoat it."
"getting frustrated, the beginning of the week, seems to be so slow",jfinks,3014219,3013931,"This is what I agree with for the most part. As for the late night anymore, it depends on where I am at around 2AM or so. If I am downtown, plaza, westport at 2am I will continue on. But a lot of times I get a ride down to OP around 1:30-2Am or so, generally I will call it a night if that happens. In other words I don't go back to Westport for the 3am close. There are exceptions if I need a little extra money, Westport is a good bet, but a gamble on if it is worth it if you are out south.I still have fun at this for the most part, 90% are enjoyable rides. I don't let myself get burnt out by driving too much."
"getting frustrated, the beginning of the week, seems to be so slow",jfinks,3017590,201523,"I saw the new navigation update so decided to try it out last night. I went to the 103rd and metcalf area to get something to eat in the late evening, then turned the app on. I made my usual rounds around OP, not venturing off too far. Nothing in about 30 minutes so I went home. While sitting in my Apt parking lot I got a ping for 2 miles away, dropped off at 135th and nall, another ping right after same corner, dropped off out east a bit. Headed home again and got a request at 125th and Bluevalley, hotel there. Went to Grandview. Headed back and took a short trip to wornall and 91st area. Headed home and got another request I ignored, a little too far away. called it a night. So about 28 bucks in 1:45, not too bad when if sitting at home I would have made nothing. The first 30 minutes of course was just driving home from going out to eat so that really doesn't count toward my time on road but I was online."

Chiefs newest acquisition is not a cool guy.,arghcd,3003929,201201,"I picked up an offensive lineman from some apartments near Briarcliff Village. He was new to Kansas City via the Cleveland Browns last week or so. Had to call him to coordinate his pickup because he used an arbitrary address. He was alright on the phone as I explained apartment pickups could be tricky. I actually ended up going out of my way to pick him and his girl up like 50 yards away. They were so ****ing ackward as they entered my vehicle, with literally barely a hello. I start the trip and it's 3700 Arrowhead Drive. I immediately think the stadium even though I know it's 1 Arrowhead Drive. He was wearing a Chiefs jumpsuit, so I asked him what his last name was after finding out he was indeed a football player. He declines to tell me his last name as I asked him if he was heading to Arrowhead, not noticing the drop off is by Independence Center. The rest of the trip he would ask me to change the radio station more times than a drunk 22 year old, despite him and the lady watching stupid ass videos way too loud the whole time. He ended up reporting me for professionalism, pickup, navigation, and 1 starring me. 1.2 million a year, **** You Cameron Erving, **** You!!"

TO MCI,aw99,2994446,200525,"When I see Kansas City International airport as a drop off location, it used to be exciting. Not anymore. Now days I don't even want to take riders that far and come back empty. Unless I have to wait there minimum for two hours there is no way I would pick up anyone back to the city. I feel like I am giving ride for half the price with already low fare."
TO MCI,jedofarc,2994460,200525,"Probably not the most helpful at 8 am lol but on weekends and afternoons and evenings I just usually drive back to zona rosa area and there's always a rider in a much shorter amount of time, but it's better than a free ride home."
TO MCI,aw99,2994475,200525,That's good to know. I might try that next time. Driving back empty all the way to Johnson county is discouraging.
TO MCI,jfinks,2995157,2994460,"Yep, that works. I think we should all just boycott the airport collectively until we can use the Cell Phone lot again. Give rides there, but never go and wait.I say that then next time I go to airport what do I do? Go to lot C.Really during peak airport traffic hours I've never waited more than 20-30 minutes or so no matter how many were in queue."
TO MCI,NGOwner,2995182,200525,"You won't drive back empty. After an airport run:I usually drive to Barry Road and wait.If within 10 minutes I don't get a ping, then I drive over towards Briarcliff and hang out there.If within 10 minutes I don't get a ping, then then North Kansas City and wait off of MO9 somewhere.Only in the rarest of circumstances do I have to actually go into KC to get a ping. Maybe 10% of the time do I make it that far. 60-70% of the time I'm busy from a ping near Barry Road.[NG]Owner"
TO MCI,jfinks,2995301,2995182,"Yep, the north can be quite busy on Friday/Sat nights. It is a lot like OP/Leawood. People up there go into the city for entertainment.I never go up north except if a ride takes me there. Once I am there I stay busy. Just watch pickup distances, a lot are a long ways away, even further north. Don't accept stacked pings since they don't give much info on pickup location/rider."
TO MCI,aw99,2995324,200525,I don't want to sound negative but after all these expenses there is not much here to gain. Only riders are getting the best of this rideshare thing. Uber-Lyft will not increase the rate anytime soon. We drivers need to exchange ideas to help each other. Thank you for sharing.
TO MCI,jfinks,2995350,0,"There is money to be made, in a solid 8 hours with a break in the middle you can do well over $150 with no surge. Add some surge and tips in there and you'd push $200. Now this is on a Fri/Sat night. It wont happen on a week day/night. Ya if you take expenses like $20 in gas and some accelerated wear and tear it would eat into that, but you do get refunded about most of that cost. You just have to weather out the year and wait until tax season.It is a 3rd shift job for sure most of the time on Uber X."
TO MCI,aw99,2995471,200525,I know there is some money to be made but not enough for 10 hrs work a day. Still it's everybody's free choice.
TO MCI,jfinks,2995489,200525,"It isn't 10 hours at the grind like you would be flipping burgers. 10 hours online is maybe 5-6 hours real work, with pax in tow.You are only out the 10 hours where you could be doing something else you like to do. But if I'm going to be laying on the couch watching TV making nothing, I'd rather be out making something, at least part of the time."
TO MCI,aw99,2995542,200525,Still not fair pay per your time and resources you invested. Long term. It may be enjoyable to drive instead of staying at home and watching TV but this shouldn't be almost free service.
TO MCI,jfinks,2995572,200525,I guess it depends on what vehicle and your expenses. I'm driving a fully depreciated vehicle. It does the job and a lot of people say it is much nicer than some other newer smaller cars they have had.I agree the base rate should be higher and I blast Uber every time when they give me that little survey. But the low per mile rate makes sense when it surges. There is still money to be made even at the about 80c per mile when you include time. In 160 miles I am going to burn through less than $20 in gas. Those are your hard right now costs. I make that in tips most nights.
TO MCI,aw99,2995635,200525,In my opinion if the rate goes up just a little bit there will be the same number of riders and drivers in the system. People are not using Uber or Lyft because it is cheap rather it is convenient and much better than Taxis. So if we are paid better it would not hurt riders that much and will keep drivers happier. I just don't get it why Uber can't understand this. I know about the competition but for how long this should go like this?
TO MCI,jfinks,2995655,200525,"Yep, and it doesn't need to be this cheap. But at the same time the surge needs capped so rates don't get out of hand in high demand times. If the base rate was more reasonable I wouldn't have any problems with the surge getting capped at about 3x. This would mean 1x is normal demand, 2x is high demand and 3x is extreme demand. Even at 3x Uber would be more expensive than a cab, but yes, much more convenient than taxi service.Though Cab companies are evolving and actually getting better due to Uber/ride share competition. Z trips and 10/10 are decent rides these days."
TO MCI,aw99,2995708,200525,Nowdays I see newer and nice looking Z-Trip cars on the road. Uber cars are becoming older and sometimes not clean.My car has almost 200k miles on it. Where is that money come from when it is time to replace it? How about you? Are you saving?
TO MCI,jedofarc,2995787,200525,"I think it all depends on how you look at Uber. I drive a newer car, but I got the car for me/family not for Uber. I also have some silly bumper to bumper service plan that covers literally everything included things like oil and lights on it. I didn't get any of this for Uber. So yeah, def adding some miles and ware and tare to the car, but I don't put a lot of miles on it for work. I also will second Jfinks... Uber sure beats working at McDonalds. I do about $14-15 an hour after gas with tips and stuff, I'm not going to pretend like theres a good way to factor in actual wear and tare on the car. Because of the way taxes work I also don't really pay hardly any taxes at all on that after deductions. Factor this against lets say some easy to get part time job thats going to pay me maybe $9? but also make me work a set schedule and lets be fair, as someone who worked Mickey d's it kind of sucks no offense if anyone on here works there now, but I'll take Uber any day over it, plus it pays almost twice as much after taxes and stuff. Its no dream job and its nothing like Uber sells it as, but it is what it is, part time money for not exactly back breaking labor."
TO MCI,jfinks,2995851,2995708,I got a buddy that goes to dealer auctions. Gotta hit him up for decent ride. My car is about 10 years old but only has about 70k on it so I am 3-4 years away from any car issues at the rate I drive.
TO MCI,aw99,2995932,200525,I think I have to rest my point now. Noone is to second me here. Jfinks and jedofarc are die-hard Uber fans.
TO MCI,jedofarc,2995949,200525,"ha I wouldn't call it die hard uber fan lol. And I definitely would never tell anyone to even consider this full time, but I still think if you understand what it is going into it, its really not a bad side gig."
TO MCI,jfinks,2995986,2995932,Your points are taken and are valid. But to say we are working for almost free is just false.
Fake requests on Friday and Saturday,,200383,0,
Fake requests on Friday and Saturday,Drunkdriverkcmo,2992303,200383,I am so sick of the Friday and Saturday night bs request. Who is doing this all evening is it cab drivers or other uber drivers. But I will say this I'm getting better at spotting the 5⭐ Riders will not be picked up by me. And if you call me to tell me I'm in the wrong spot I'm not moving till it's changed in the app. But really these are people trying to make money for what ever reason. How does someone think this is ok but looking for suggestions on how to quit getting more bs requests than real ones. Thanks.
Fake requests on Friday and Saturday,jfinks,2995131,200383,"Best thing to do is just not take any pickups more than 3-4 miles away. This limits your time investment if it is fake. Sometimes I don't take anything more than a couple miles if work is steady. If work is slow, I will go up to 3-4 miles or 8-10 minutes. Get to destination and collect no show fee if it is in safe area and carry on.Yes, avoid 5 star riders in ""bad"" areas, and long distances away. Be smarter than the fakes. It has gotten better now that the rider cancel window is 2 minutes. A lot of times I will wait a minute before moving then watch carefully for a cancel up to 2 minutes. Then after 2 minutes you are at least guaranteed a no show fee if it is fake. If it is a couple miles drive go, wait, and either give a ride or collect the fee. Don't wait a second over the 5 minutes. If rider calls before the 5 minutes I might wait a bit longer."

Uber Money,NGOwner,2937412,196686,"I just did a spot check of the Service Fees that Uber takes. I looked at all the rides that I gave this week. It's best to do it online, as each trip opens up in a new window and makes it relatively easy to compare and contrast service fees across rides, and in particular, across mileages. The number of miles driven will be a pretty good proxy for how much Uber should take from a particular fare. It should be pretty easy to spot an outlier that way.In my case things seem to be mostly kosher. I think I may have found a $2 discrepancy. The amounts are generally so low, and it's so infrequent that it may not make sense to track down every discrepancy. But it does point to a disturbing reality. If it is occurring to each of us 10% of the time for small amounts, over time and over all Uber drivers, it adds up to some significant bottom line padding for Uber. Friggin' thiefs.[NG]Owner"
Uber Money,DiceyDan,2984637,196686,The fact that it has to get to this level is alarming. This can't go on forever and it can't be legal. This company certainly pushes the envelope. It is exhausting keeping up with these crooks.

Event,MattChance,2942414,192311,"In my market, Uber recently put an ad in my app advertising a concert as well as tips for where Uber drivers should perform dropoffs for it. Thus far I have only seen one event pop up, despite my area having events every night. I did receive a small list in an email as well. I wonder if it only displays the amphitheaters that paid to advertise on the Uber app?I am also curious if when you ""set a destination"" in app - then set it to an arena/venue, does it pair you with drivers headed to that event? Or would it still be squeezing in any trips that are just in that general path and direction?"
Event,jfinks,2950537,2866919,We used to get regular Sprint Center notifications but it seems those have stopped. I think the Z trip boys did some deep throating of the Sprint center execs because it looks like they have an exclusive at the Sprint Center now.

Kansas City Mo driver looking for a vehicle.,aw99,2965741,198613,I don't think it will work for both you and the owner of the car with this low rate. How long do you have to work to pay for yourself and the owner? I have two cars. I tried it to help a guy who didn't have a car.

Airport queue,reo47,2764300,185655,The number of drivers in the airport queue seems way up the last few days. I'm seeing 80 - 95 waiting. How many hours do you have to wait with over 90 cars ahead of you?
Airport queue,jfinks,2764398,185655,Couple hours probably. I don't know why guys sit at the airport. It is hot as F and you will want to sit there with your car idling for the A/C.
Airport queue,KCDriver,2825229,185655,I’ve noticed that a 737 in the evening seems to have about 10 pax request a ride; does that seem about right or is it just a coincidence?
Airport queue,jfinks,2825295,2825229,"Really have no idea, there are lots of transportation options. They could have their own car in a lot, Taxi, Uber, friend/family pick up, hotel shuttle, etc. As it gets later in the evening the planes may not even be full or they could even be empty and the airline is just moving planes."
Airport queue,NGOwner,2827809,185655,"I've noticed the same. And now that Lyft is there, there are another 20-30 cars in that queue. And I know there is some double counting going on, but still. Way too many cars for too few rides. When I started a year ago, I figured about 2-3 minutes per vehicle waiting. I've experienced nothing to change that. So your 80 - 95 cars means a minimum of 160-240 minutes of waiting. Just not worth it.[NG]Owner"
Airport queue,jfinks,2827914,185655,I have good luck getting a ride out of the airport most times within 30-45 minutes. Last weekend (7-23) it was a matter of minutes. As soon as I logged on boom had a ride. I never have the app open and online until I get to lot C. It seems like it takes forever to get in the queue if you enter with the app on.

Airport queue,jfinks,2951328,185655,"It's dumb that we can't use the Cell phone lot. Things were so much smoother then. You could be at the terminal in 2 minutes and gone.

Whoever thought that up needs a kick in the balls, then fired and kicked out on their ass."

Airport queue,jedofarc,2951475,185655,Airport is super hit or miss. I've watched a 60 person queue empty out on like 2 flights and I've start there once with less than 30 for over 6 flights. I'm not the biggest fan of airport waiting... But it def can be good if things go well... I remember one time I waited closer to an hour for a north KC ride that netted like $7.
Airport queue,jfinks,2951582,185655,"Ya, I've been lucky and never had a ride shorter than downtown. The worst would be waiting that long and dropping off at an airport hotel. However I think it is built into the system where you will get bumped up in the queue if it is a short trip close by."
Airport queue,jedofarc,2951589,185655,Experiences from not waking in que show me that I can get almost to Barry road exit on 29 before it drops me from que.
Airport queue,JoeBuckYourself,2959498,185655,"Had a ride that took me to MCI this Tuesday around 2:30 pm, only 19 cars in Uber's queue and several flight arriving soon so I waited. Took almost 2 hours to get a request, and about 15 flights landing. So unless the queue is less than 10, or I need a break, I doubt I wait there anymore."
Airport queue,jfinks,2959510,185655,"Ya it is hit or miss, I've seen 36 cars in queue and waited 30-40 minutes. So don't let one time waiting that long turn you off of it. Come prepared, I've seen some guys use that time to clean car in the lot.But I know what you mean, in that 2 hours waiting you could have given 3-4 rides or more instead of idling. As long as planes were coming in I've never waited more than an hour."
Airport queue,Kima1117,2962672,185655,How do u know when you are added to the queue? Do you get a notification? Or do you just want for a ride to pop up?

I just did a drop off an hour or so ago and got put in as soon as I got to the terminal area and I wasn't even planning on hanging around it was like 40 deep are you logged in? Maybe someone else can help I've not had that experience before. Sorry!

Airport queue,jedofarc,2962764,2962745,"So the queuing should happen or at least it does for me as I drive into the airport area to drop off people. Did you drop anyone off or did you just drive up to the airport? And lot c like past the gas station where I've peed many a times, not like the cell lot at terminal c. The only thing I can think of is maybe you were outside of where they wanted you and they took you it of que, I know sometimes I'll get a warning like get to lot c or you will be removed from que. it's been a while since I've sat in line at the airport, I know some people love it, it's just not my thing.

Uber...Is it true?,,197967,0,
Uber...Is it true?,aw99,2954806,197967,"Full disclosure..Just read a comment on the local Uber website. Wanted to share it here. Not my words. You are new or veteran drivers. What are your opinions? Please read below.....Please, if you are an Uber driver, keep a detailed spreadsheet of just how much per hour you're making, factoring in taxes. Weigh that against how much damage and depreciation your car is taking, increased insurance premiums, fuel, etc. and seriously understand just how much you're making hourly. If you are not doing this, then you have no stance to argue in favor of Uber. What Uber is doing basically amounts to stealing your time and the equity out of your car to line their pockets while you take all the risk. Their 25% commission is greedy at best and much closer to onerous. I can make a long list of their questionable business . If you are a new driver, the glitz and convenience wears off rather quickly once you run the numbers and understand how much you're invested."
Uber...Is it true?,jfinks,2954899,197967,It just depends really. It is trading miles on your car for cash. It accelerates wear on your car. As a flexible second job it is great. Do it when you want and need to. Make 800-1000 a month and call it good. That is my advice. Don't try to make a living at it unless you have no choice in the short term. For example if I lost my current job and went to school to train for a new career I would ramp up my Uber driving to make ends meet. But I wouldn't drive any more than I had to.
Uber...Is it true?,NGOwner,2954936,197967,"I agree with jfinks.Driving for Uber in a nutshell: Take a $20 value chunk of your car, and turn it into a crisp $10 bill.The older the car, the closer the two values above become as depreciation of your vehicle becomes less and less of a factor (but remember that maintenance costs for older cars ramp up). It's not a money maker insofar as the revenues you make will not be enough to replace your vehicle when it goes **** up. Driving for Uber is a source of cash flow as you drive your asset into the ground. Nothing more.[NG]Owner"
Uber...Is it true?,jfinks,2954977,197967,"Yep, I would only do this in an 8-10 year old car worth about $6-8k, preferably under $10k. Select you could go a little higher, maybe $20k, but still 4-5 year old car probably. Always try to get a car with the bulk of the initial depreciation realized. Program cars from rental companies or dealerships are a great place to start.On top of that, try to secure a cheap alternative for car maintenance instead of a dealership."
Uber...Is it true?,aw99,2959515,197967,It is not a secret now you can only do this to supplement your primary source of income. Driving with late model cars is not wise. That's right 8-10 years old cars make sense. It is more expensive for Select.
Uber...Is it true?,jedofarc,2959552,197967,"Yeah, all based on what works... I sure wish this was around when I was in college, I would have done it in a heartbeat. 100% beats most all college jobs I had..."

Ihad referred my niece who lives in Kansas City, Ks. and I see the referral is$150.00 after only 20 trips. This kinda tells me the market is a little differentthan Hampton Roads.Are there any part timers in the KC, Ks. area that can give me an idea ofwhat a part time Uber driver earns daily/weekly ? I have averaged $10.00an hour here in HR.Secondly, is it at all possible to get registered to Uber in both KC, Ks. and KC, Mo. ?Like if I get a trip from KC, Ks. to the Missouri side, then drive around in Mo. ? ordead mile it back to KC, Ks. ?Can't wait to get back to Kansas...being away 17 years.... 17 years too long ;-)"

Once you confirm it's streaming feel free to pause it or leave it doesn't matter. Easy way to confirm that the app is feeding to you're speakers. You'll find more times than not it takes some fiddling (signs that you aren't connected via the app to your speakers like you think, even if your phone is connected).

The surge eventually went away so I waited a little longer and a surge popped up in the Rain Tree area. It was only about 5 to 10 minutes from where I was, so I headed that way. I got there, waited and got nothing. About 10 minutes later that surge went away. It looked like almost the whole KC area was in a surge at one point.

I was at the airport looking at all the surges so I went exploring and didn't get a single hit, Olathe had a surge up to 4.2x but it was just dead as could be. I learned my lesson and stay in on Saturday nights."
Sat night fake surge.,jedofarc,2877061,0,"IMO Saturday nights are good, but as a general rule of thumb I don't chase surges unless im less than 3 miles away. Just stick to where you know works for you and unusually do fine on Saturday's. That being said I did not put much stock in this one because I knew like half the people I work with at the day job were going to one of the various out of town lakes lol. Schools coming back though so so will the people. Although I did catch a fair share of wedding goers this Saturday... I felt very under dressed."
Sat night fake surge.,JT21491,2877799,176040,"Passengers have this surge thing figured out too. Last night I dropped a PAX off right on the edge of Lee's summit and Blue Springs. Blue Spring had a surge that was dark red. (I didn't look to see what the pay rate was). So I sat there and waited for a few minutes and sure enough I got a ping right in the surge. The app said 20 minutes away, but seeing the surge I accepted. I hopped on 291 and headed that way and within in the 5 minute window the PAX canceled. About 30 seconds later I get a ping form the exact same place and I declined it. I got about 4 or 5 more request from the same place and I didn't accept any of them. Homie don't play those games! Uber finally kicked me offline. I know the guy saw I was 20 minutes away so he thought he would just keep requesting and canceling until the surge went away. John I hope you're still standing there waiting on a ride!"
Sat night fake surge.,Carnal Sanders,2886782,176040,250 rides given and I've never gotten a surge. I've been dead center in the dark red and never gotten a request except for one time at Kaufman and it didn't pay surge was in the car for an hour and 15 minutes to Liberty and only made $19. Lame.

I'm debating between my original plan of a Ford C-Max vs a Used BMW for roughly the same cost."
"Kansas City market for UberSELECT, and Lyft Plus",aw99,2875273,192824,I would say C Max. You will run X the whole day with your BMW. Very low demand for select.
"Kansas City market for UberSELECT, and Lyft Plus",Atlien23,2913455,192824,Not worth it in KC. Get a hybrid or a car good on gas
"Kansas City market for UberSELECT, and Lyft Plus",jfinks,2917586,192824,"I needed a short ride to work a couple months ago and decided to try out Select. Service was ok, guy showed up in a Lexus CT, kind of a small hatch back. It wasn't worth the extra I spent for the ride which was more than double what I paid in the past for X. The reason I mention this is because other Riders probably felt the same thing and would decide not to order a select because of the much higher mileage rate for not much nicer car. I didn't expect a Luxury vehicle to show up, but for what it cost my expectations were higher. Funny thing is if i ordered an X ride the same guy/car probably would have shown up."
"Kansas City market for UberSELECT, and Lyft Plus",Cadi,2920039,192824,The thing about Select is leather. If you have a suit or anything nice you take a gamble on X. Smells and stains on cloth seats are hard to get out. Leather you just wipe it clean.
Question about rating your passenger,,195472,0,
Question about rating your passenger,JT21491,2917440,195472,"Can the passenger see what rating you gave them, before they rate the driver?The reason is I had a guy Saturday night that I should have rated a 1 or 2, but I gave him a 5 because I thought he may give me a bad rating."
Question about rating your passenger,jfinks,2917481,195472,"They can't see what rating, but most riders have very low ""trips"" compared to drivers so any low rating can move their average quite a bit. One of the big problem with Uber is the ratings. Riders should get a weekly rating movement to try to disguise which trip or driver rated them low. Drivers are most of the time more honest about trips than riders and Drivers have more riding on the rating than a rider does. If a rider's rating goes low they can just sign up with another card/account. A driver can be permanently kicked off the system. I am sure there are plenty of drivers that eventually deserve to get kicked off."
Question about rating your passenger,JT21491,2917836,195472,I'm no doctor but the guy obviously wasn't playing with a full deck and then he had WAY too much to drink on top of that. It just wasn't a good situation to be in. Thank god it was a short trip.I might wait a week a few days and send uber a message and ask them to change the rating. Other drivers need to be aware of some people.

Double tips,jedofarc,2884306,2884291,lol the funny thing is ever since in app tipping has come around I think the rate of cash tips for me has actually gone up... whatever all the same for me lol (except double tip night lol)
Double tips,jfinks,2884334,193404,"Ya, I was thinking about that today. I think it was ingrained into riders heads that tips weren't accepted for some reason. Now that tips are in the app they know they can now tip and I guess some prefer to tip in cash. My tips have definitely gone up a bit, not enough, but it is a start.I mean when you take 4 riders to a location and they are trying to split a min fare between them, you know you aren't getting a tip. Broke asses."
Double tips,jedofarc,2884343,2884334,I've been a little surprised with how unbalanced the tipping is too. Maybe its because I've never been a food server or whatever but I'll go like 3 or 4 people with no tips on decent sized rides... then I'll get some guy who I take 2 miles and he gives me $5.
Double tips,arghcd,2884636,193404,That is my exact experience too! The short distance riders often seem to be the most generous.
Double tips,USPTURNKEY,2888180,193404,From working in another transportation industry the people that tip you will often times surprise you. i once had a bus full of grade school kids who each tipped me a $1.00 never saw it coming...I have hauled professional sports teams and will not get a dime..

I had a rider last night tip me $10 while sitting in my from seat via pax app. It never showed on my end. What did show was a large service charge for Uber and I got $6 for a $20 fare charged to the rider. Looking at the same route on the pax app it was a $10 ride. After going back and forth with Uber via support messages with redundant auto responses they finally gave me my tip from their inflated service charge.It took a few more emails to actually see it happen but they did give it to me.They also gave me a $1 tip that wasn't showing up also that I wasn't even aware of.Sorry if this has been plastered on here already just want to be sure we're not missing out on our in app tips!GmbbodyMemberLocation:MiamiDriving:UberXL

Any long-haul trips??,UberRazor,2701643,181683,"Has anyone had the opportunity to complete an out of the ordinary long trip? Say to Manhattan or Wichita, or St. Charles, etc?Well, last night was my first long haul! Obviously didn't know where I would be heading until I got to the ""passenger"" location for p/u (and the px didn't text or call me once I accepted to let me know where I'd be headed to make sure I'd be cool with it). Upon arrival at just before 10pm, the gentleman asked if i realized his destination was Wichita....I said, ""negative, I cannot see the location until i arrive and start the trip.""A very nice fella, he allowed me to call the significant other (she didn't pick up the phone) and so I pulled the trigger! I used the term passenger in quotes above because I wasn't driving the gentleman to Wichita; I was delivering a package....A PACEMAKER! I wasn't really feeling it once he had told me I was heading to Wichita and realizing I wouldn't be home until 3am but having the opportunity to deliver a pacemaker to someone in obvious dire need that they need to Uber and not waiting to ship it the next day it made me feel good to help out in such a way! (even though I wasn't totally sure if it was a dire need truly; until I got to the drop off location).I must say, there is no better passenger than a small 4 x 6 box that won't give me grief over my choice of music, ask for an aux cable, have my stop at a fast food place ""on the way"" and/or smell up my vehicle!No chit chat, just a straight shot to Wichita with no words....it was a beautiful thing!I finally get to the destination around 12:30am and the recipient was eagerly waiting so I had to ask her what the deal was for the pacemaker....she said the doctor contacted the her and the person in the greater KC area that they needed a smaller part-for-the-heart (my terminology) because the person getting operated on was a very tiny individual and realized they didn't have the proper pacemaker at the hospital for the 8am surgery. Man, I felt good about the down to Wich and back knowing I actually helped someone out like that!And a little icing on the cake; she tipped me generously!What is weird though; the dang Uber app still hasn't calculated my trip total yet....sum *****es. Hopefully it'll kick in this morning to show how much it was (i'm guessing it'll work out to around $35/hr for the 5 hour round trip). Regardless of the amount; I'm feeling good about that trip. I wish I could do that more often although I'm paying the toll this morning by sitting here typing and spacing out with tiredness at my ""real"" job.Anyone else with some nice long distance haul stories?Sorry mine was so long, just thought it was a good story to share."

Things like how long I have already been driving that day, day of week, and mabye negotiate a hotel stay/return fee.Check with Uber, I have heard that they sometimes pay a return trip fee. I suppose it gets billed back to the rider, in full or part. It might have to be a very long distance, Wichita isn't too bad.Furthest I have been is from Wornal/103rd to Leavenworth. I figured I would be dead heading back but ended up with a ping about 5 miles west of Leavenworth out in the fields and pasture.

When I see that I just turn and drive south empty hoping I will pick up someone on the way. It doesn't make sense for me to sit for two hours there for just $18 fare.Yesterday I dropped off a rider and decided to try my luck on both lyft and Uber. It started 50-60 on Uber and 34 people on Lyft ahead of me around 4:30 pm. After an hour and half it got down to 1-10 on Uber and 3 on Lyft.I received a request from Lyft first. It was my first Lyft airport pick up. Just to Marriott downtown. Do you guys notice fare differences between Uber and Lyft? I thought I made more money on Lyft. Got $2 cash tip too.
Lyft,NGOwner,2865617,192175,"My rule of thumb at the airport has been 2-3 minutes per waiting Uber vehicle. And your experience seemed to be about 2 minutes per vehicle, even at that time of day.

"Slow in OP last night, 8/10/17",jfinks,2870615,192553,"Got off work at 5, grabbed a snack and went through the car wash. Gassed up at costco. Turned app on and did a lap from Metcalf/119th to Renner/119th, North to college then back east on College. No fish bites, not even a peep. Called it quits and went home. I am sure it would have gotten better later, but usually I get something in that amount of time. Oh well. Try for a busy weekend I guess."
"Slow in OP last night, 8/10/17",ScubaSteve2177,2870661,192553,"Do you drive mainly OP & JoCo?I live up north but work out south - can never decide which is better. Also, what do you classify as a good/busy weekend?"
"Slow in OP last night, 8/10/17",jfinks,2870693,192553,"I go all over really, but not much east of 71 hwy. I am happy if I am out for 8 hours and make $160. I did it one weekend day with no surge. I'd say that is my goal for a weekend night starting late evening. On a week night I like to make 30-40 in 2-3 hours or so. Of course it would be great if it was way more, but after about 3 hours if things aren't hopping I'm done. Or if things are stupid like 10-15 mile pickups, like to Gardner or something dumb like that I just quit. Yes I get pings for Gardner/New Century from OP..."
"Slow in OP last night, 8/10/17",ScubaSteve2177,2870725,192553,"Nice, I usually do 10pm-2am downtown/midtown/westport and shoot for $100 in 4 hours. Don't always make it, but it's the goal. Maybe I'll see what it's like after work today out south.I probably take too many trips far away (5+ miles), so I just need to be more patient."
"Slow in OP last night, 8/10/17",jfinks,2870766,192553,"Ya 5 miles is really a long ways especially on city streets. I try to keep it within 3-4 miles max. There are exceptions like over 5 miles into a large surge. That happens sometimes. 5 miles if you are on a highway isn't so bad, I'll take those if the pickup is close to the highway exit.When things are working well with the system most pings are pretty close so I just take whatever comes. It is just when it gets stupid, and a lot of pings 10-15 miles away I am sure are fake. I don't bother with them. A lot of us think cab drivers just make fake requests while waiting, just to make ubers scatter all over the place. Don't fall for it."
"Slow in OP last night, 8/10/17",ScubaSteve2177,2870953,192553,"Never knew about those dang cabbies.Knowing that, I think I've gotten one or two down in westport before."
"Slow in OP last night, 8/10/17",jfinks,2871050,192553,Ya they have nothing better to do while waiting in their line 20 deep. I think 2 minutes to cancel put a damper on some of it because before they would wait almost 5 minutes and cancel. That 2 minutes goes fast and a lot of times I barely make any headway and 2 minutes has passed.
Lyft Cancelled My Ride,,191707,0,
Lyft Cancelled My Ride,thefakened,2856874,191707,"Was on my way to work from the Northland this morning, and logged on to see if I could get anything headed the same way. I got a ping in Lyft at Harrah's casino. At the time I was about 12 minutes away (I know - I should've left it) but I was already in Northtown so I took it.I went down 210 towards Harrah's and just as I was turning onto Choteau and then into Harrah's, sure enough, the ride cancelled on me. I'm less than 1 minute away at that point.So once I got to work, I sent in a request because Lyft has the 5 Rule - if you've been traveling 5+ minutes and you're less than 5 minutes away, you're entitled to something when the ride cancels. (I'm new to both Lyft and Uber.)So support tells me that the Lyft app cancelled the ride when it showed I wasn't traveling toward the destination. I'm wondering if maybe it picked me up nearing Harrah's and once I headed towards Chouteau, it thought I was going away? There's only one way in and out of Harrah's and I was right on it.Anyway, they said I'm not eligible for any cancellation and I guess from the customer's perspective, I stood him up. Not a huge deal, but if there's something different I need to do, I'd just like to know what that was.Anybody seen this before? Glitch? Don't accept 12 minute rides? I'm ready for any advice."

I will be in school during the week but have my weekends open. I'm new to the area so I would like any of your advice on if this is a good area to be driving in and which areas around me tend to be the most popular. To me, it feels like this would be a pretty good area to start driving. Thanks for the help!"
Between Westport and Downtown,KCDriver,2848997,190694,"Westport is a huge pain in the ass, spend some time looking at the map to learn how to get into and out of the pickup zone when the roads are closed. Other than that your area is pretty decent."
Between Westport and Downtown,jfinks,2850962,190694,"Westport is a pain, but some really good paying rides can be had from there in peak times. It is worth it to end your Friday/Saturday night work.30th and main should be good and will be in surge off and on Friday and Saturday evenings and night."

New Missouri Regulations,avguste,2385972,160251,Greitens just signed a statewide law regarding Uber and Lyft. Read the details athttp://fox2now.com/2017/04/24/with-greitens-signature-uber-and-lyft-can-operate-throughout-missouri/The full bill can be readhereOne question though. Do new KCMO drivers still have to go to BizCare and Regulated Industries?
New Missouri Regulations,kojeislandincha,2386336,160251,Awesome! Invisible Hand Prevails
New Missouri Regulations,avguste,2505693,160251,So anyone knows whether new KC drivers still need to go to BizCare and Regulated Industries?
New Missouri Regulations,jfinks,2507081,2505693,Why wouldn't they?
New Missouri Regulations,avguste,2513028,160251,"Well, if I am reading the bill correctly, the state bill overwrites any city bills. Which would then mean that BizCare and Regulated Industries would not be needed anymore for Uber drivers"
New Missouri Regulations,jfinks,2517192,0,I haven't read it. Uber requires it for now in an agreement with KCMO. There is tax revenue involved so I am sure the city won't want to lose that.
New Missouri Regulations,cheapinkc,2527707,2513028,The bill has not gone into effect yet so until 8/28/17 the current regulations apply.
New Missouri Regulations,jfinks,2527732,160251,"Regulated Industries does background checks and issues permits, I don't see that going away. Really you don't want BizCare and RI removed, in business you like some ""barriers to entry"" for new drivers. Sure MO costs 1 percent, just expense it out."
New Missouri Regulations,avguste,2528559,160251,"Makes sense. Wasnt there also a Uber KC site with the BizCare and RI form? I am searching on google, but cant seem to find it anymore."
New Missouri Regulations,avguste,2584350,160251,Found another article about the new regulations and looks to me that the new law is removing both Bizcare and RI requirements. The article basically says the city will lose tax revenue.http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/technology/article146776314.html
New Missouri Regulations,jfinks,2584738,160251,"Interesting they were able to get that passed with all the hoopla about background checks. RI does a more thorough check, and would do it before getting a new permit each year. All it will take is one bad driver to hurt someone and it could all fall apart."
New Missouri Regulations,kojeislandincha,2587995,160251,Why would we need Regulations for giving Grandma a ride to Church?
New Missouri Regulations,jfinks,2588035,2587995,"That's pretty dumb and narrow minded to the reality of ride share and ""ride for hire"" in general."
New Missouri Regulations,kojeislandincha,2588071,160251,Safety is not Dumb
New Missouri Regulations,jfinks,2588222,2588071,"I didn't say it was. The regulations do more than background checks. Permits on your car get you into the ""special"" area of the stadium. These permits and those who issue them are not free. This is what regulations do. It isn't overly expensive for the driver each year. One or 2 good trips pays for it. The city 1% tax can go away, not even sure what it pays for, it probably goes into the general fund for street maintenance type of stuff. Kansas doesn't have any tax, but they might have an agreement with MO to get a portion of that 1% as it would be silly to have drivers do Kansas and MO taxes/permits separately."
New Missouri Regulations,kojeislandincha,2588247,160251,"Hard at work......RideShare has hired the best of the best. You know today I watched Wonder Woman...Great ! 5 Stars!

New Missouri Regulations,avguste,2821714,160251,Happy to see this bill is fully in effect now
New Missouri Regulations,jedofarc,2823639,160251,"So I didn't get to dig toooo deeply, but I think... and maybe not someone else chime in here you will still have to pay 1% KCMO tax, assuming you don't operate at a loss... which everyone should be right about even on."
New Missouri Regulations,jfinks,2825348,160251,"Not sure on the tax, it is tied to your business license so no license no, no account, no tax??? The 1% was on gross fares, it didn't matter if you operated at a loss. I wonder how this will work at restricted venues like the stadiums. When the parking guys see your sticker they allow entrance and direct you through the lot."
New Missouri Regulations,NGOwner,2827847,0,"I think this is incorrect. The tax is figured on profit. Not gross fares. This is a business, not a wage. therefore, the tax is on profits.What deductions can I take on my Profits Tax return?The City allows ordinary and necessary expenses as determined for the purpose of Federal taxable income. The City does not allow deductions related to unearned income, special deductions or credits.Source:http://kcmo.gov/tax/tax-home/faq/business/[NG]Owner"
New Missouri Regulations,jfinks,2827903,160251,"The tax is a Use tax, kind of like sales tax. It is only 1% so not that much. They wouldn't collect anything at all if rideshares deducted expenses.I only worked a couple months part time last year and made 1750 or so. I filled out the form and paid like 17.50. No bid deal really."
New Missouri Regulations,NGOwner,2827999,160251,"Yet again, I think you are incorrect.I am a resident of Kansas City, Missouri but work outside of Kansas City, Missouri. Am I subject to the one percent earnings tax on the monies I earn outside of Kansas City, Missouri?Yes, the monies earned by residents are subject to the City's one percent earnings tax regardless of where they are earned unless exempted by state statute or municipal ordinance. Residents who are self-employed must pay the one percent tax on thenet profit of their businessby filing a profits return with the Revenue Division by April 15 of each year.Emphasis mine.Source:http://kcmo.gov/tax/tax-home/faq/business/You gave the city $17.50 it wasn't entitled to.[NG]Owner"
New Missouri Regulations,jfinks,2828319,160251,"Hmm, ya maybe have to send them a bill. At the time I didn't have my 2016 tax done so I just paid the 1% since it wasn't much."
New Missouri Regulations,avguste,2838751,160251,"Regarding stadiums, I had only 1 problem my first time there (beginning of June). Since that time, I just tell them I am an Uber/Lyft driver and they let me pass on Gate 1. I am actually also thinking of getting an Uber/Lyft sign to use only for stadiums"
New Missouri Regulations,jedofarc,2839849,2838751,I was nervous had my first stadium drop off last night but they were alarming agreeable... I didn't even point to that pink sticker they just waived me through to the drop-off road in front of the stadium. Hope they all go that smoothly lol.
New Missouri Regulations,jfinks,2839966,160251,"They are trained to look for the sticker, I imagine next years sticker will be a different color. This is what I am wondering about the whole business license deal and Regulated Industries. Taxes pay for that permit and those that grant them. If that is going away then curious to what we need to do. The stadiums do pop up the special screen when you are in the area so you would have to show that I guess."
New Missouri Regulations,jedofarc,2839969,2839966,"Honestly, if the city offers them and keeps the same privileges with them open, Ill throw them the $16 and save the headache."
New Missouri Regulations,jfinks,2839978,2839969,Mine is good until the end of year and that is pretty much end of Chiefs regular season also. So really no hurry until next April when Royals start back up.
New Missouri Regulations,jedofarc,2839982,2839978,Do they run a year from when you bought it? I though the lady told me that it expired every Dec31! hmpf lol. Now I want to go look at my sticker...
New Missouri Regulations,jfinks,2839985,160251,"End of year all expire, even if you got one in December."

And even if they are, we have the state law on our side and state law supercedes local law.It is no longer needed. State law supercedes local regulationsClick to expand...Probably correct, but for now the sticker stays on cause it makes things easier at the stadiums. I don't particularly like the sticker cause all the cabs know you are an uber. I like to keep it on the down low. I know cabs and other taxis are kind of bitter toward Uber/Lyft like always, so just want to go about my business without them noticing too much."
New Missouri Regulations,Atlien23,2840180,2838751,I used my Uber GoBank card there are verification at Gate 1 and it works well. I don't want uber/lyft signs on my car they don't pay enough for that lol.

Kauffman Stadium,jfinks,2839972,190569,"Generally drop off is right there at the right field Gate D, I suppose some riders would prefer to be taken around to the other left field side but no one has ever requested that.

Kauffman Stadium,NGOwner,2839990,190569,"For drop offs, when you get off I-70 at the Stadium be in the far right line.

2017 USATF Hershey National Junior Olympic Track & Field Championships,AARRR,2758776,185339,"For those that don't know, you have a big event coming to Lawrence next week. The 2017 USATF Hershey National Junior Olympic Track & Field Championships will be in Lawrence from July 24 - 31. Almost 10,000 kids from all over the country will be in attendance as well as their parents, siblings & coaches. My team will be there and we are bringing 25 families. Lawrence hotels are completely sold out so many are staying in Overland Park, Topeka, Bonner Springs, De Soto, etc. Rental cars are scarce so as we normally do, we rely on Uber/Lyft. It might be a good idea if some of you were available at the airport on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday when the bulk of the participants will be arriving at MCI and looking for transportation as far west as Topeka. There will be many requests back and forth from area hotels to Rock Chalk Park where the event will be held. This should provide long trips for you all with good tips to be made.Event details here:http://www.usatf.org/Events---Calendar/2017/USATF-National-Junior-Olympic-Track---Field-C.aspxLooking forward to visiting your area of the world!FYI, I arrive at around 2:30 on Tuesday the 25th and I'm heading to Lawrence.

Found rides to and from the airport by enthusiastic and very nice people. Met lots of great drivers in my week stay in Lawrence and thanks to all.Unfortunately, I think some of you missed the boat. Lawrence was hopping. My flight came in from Dallas (Originating at SFO) with 15 families that all wanted Uber/Lyft rides on Tuesday at around 3PM... and that was only my flight, I suspect there were far more of the same considering that almost 8000 kids attended and most arrived on Monday - Wednesday at MCI. I paid $75.09 for my ride from MCI to Lawrence and that includes the $15 tip. My ride back to the airport was $89.08 including tip. (Not sure why such a difference in pricing given the destinations and start points were the same, but I digress.)For those that read this thread and acted on it... good for you, I hope you made a bundle that week.

My first 7 trips,,189262,0,
My first 7 trips,thefakened,2822473,189262,"Hey all - just puttered about this weekend trying this out. Ended up having to get a new (to me) car recently and hoping to at least offset some of the payment for it. My dad Uber's here in town - so here I go.Would love any additional suggestions if you see anything I'm doing wrong.Started on Friday - I had to go downtown to the Greenlight Hub and was after work on Friday. Walked out and it was a surge - so I turned the app on and got a fare from the Marriott to the Airport. $19. So easy, right?(Reminds me of the first time I gambled at the casino. I won $100 which obviously meant that life would be great from there on out. Right?)Had to get home and didn't really want to futz waiting at the airport. So logged off for the day.Started early Sunday morning because Dad said there's a lot of airport shuttling goin on - and sure enough my first fare was a hotel in NKC to the airport. Then a quick commuter in Farrelview behind the airport just up the street to work.Then I'm up north and it's still fairly early so I sat for about 30 minutes. Got relatively bored and it was getting hot so I logged off.Went back out Sunday afternoon and got a really nice couple who I took downtown - got to show them a couple of places to check out. That's the part I really like about this - getting to show off my city. Even got my first tip. Then while I was dropping them off, I got another pax at the Westin to the airport. All in about 45 minutes.And then it dried up completely during the last part of the Royals game. I think I picked up maybe one more person for a quick run to Westport and was really, really quiet.Evening rush hour and weekends are likely to be the only times I'll have a chance to do this - but did make $20 my first day and $60 on Sunday. I get what everyone says about it being not a lot of net income - but being able to set your own hours and do it when you have a little bit of time does help a lot.Biggest questions I've got so far are good places to camp. I live up north but also had to drive my son up to Kearney and obviously, I didn't get anything on the way back. So just learning what will work and what won't.Looking forward to contributing here!"
My first 7 trips,jedofarc,2823672,189262,"I'm not sure what you're personal goals are with this but it sounds like you're just doing it for extra cash when you have the time which is what I feel like most people in KC at least use it for. IMO Fri-and Sat Nights are where you're going to be busiest. Just hang around the normal entertainment spots and you can ride it all the way from the evening to as long as you can keep your eyes open, might want to invest in some barf bags for your back seat though. Most nights you can catch a decent chunk of riders but nothing to write home about. Ive only been doing it for a little over a month but Ive got it down to where some weeknights and weekends I can keep it at about $15-$20 an hour (thanks in app tipping). It feels like during the week I do a lot fewer rides but a tend to get longer distances which for me is just as easy. Hope this helps."
My first 7 trips,jfinks,2825326,189262,"When ever you end up at the airport since you dropped off it is almost always good to spend the time to get in queue for a ride back down south. Especially if it is mid evening and lots of planes coming in. So essentially that 20 you got going to the airport probably will more than double if you can hang out for 20-30 minutes or so. I live way south so I never go to the airport unless a rider takes me there. Then I almost always get in queue. Worst part about it is how far away the lot is, which sucks. But it is what it is. Just make a pit stop at the gas station and grab a couple snacks before going to the staging lot C."

Has the business liense requirement increased you income?,,169937,0,
Has the business liense requirement increased you income?,Vegas E,2526700,169937,We are on the verge of implementing a business license requirement in Las Vegas and many drivers here seem to think that implementing a business license requirement for rideshare drivers will increase their income. Perhaps you drivers in KC can enlighten us?
Has the business liense requirement increased you income?,jfinks,2539871,169937,"Really can't say, it would be very hard to quantify. Generally a barrier to enter a market is good, but the business license in KC costs about $30 bucks and 1% revenue per year. Not much of a barrier but it is one.A lot of new drivers sign up to get the bonus in the first month then never drive again. You don't need the business license until after 30 days in KC."

Has the business liense requirement increased you income?,jfinks,2728625,169937,"Think it is because a lot of drivers might not get a Business licence and just stop driving. Less drivers, more money for each driver. Maybe. You still gotta do the miles, maybe they are thinking less drivers and more surge."

Dive Bars,jedofarc,2798524,187767,"So maybe I just missed out by not being much of a drinker, but one of the bigger surprises for me since driving with Uber have been the number of people who are just destroyed, and call for a car at a dive bar in lets say... Lenexa and they need a ride all the way back to say Blue Springs... Looks like they weren't drinking with friends... at least none that were willing to drive them home... but its not just one... its a few a week and usually on week nights... is it normal to go get wasted at a nothing bar 40 miles from home just because?"

Tablets,,185747,0,
Tablets,jedofarc,2765970,185747,Here's a quick question... anyone use a small tablet for the partner app instead of their phone?
Tablets,KC_Ride,2766175,185747,I have see some folks using tablets. Problem is hard to carry.
Tablets,jedofarc,2766185,2766175,"Yeah, I was thinking more like a tab A or something, iPad mini size... and get a little mount for it in the car or something... hmmm"
Tablets,aw99,2767947,185747,Use just your phone and drive in style. You have a lot of expenses. Don't think you're making a lot of money. You are not. Unless you are a new driver no one wants to spend more money for this low low rate. Save your money. One device is better than two. I know these greedy phone companies want to sell you anything. Don't taker it.
Tablets,jedofarc,2768155,185747,"Ehhh I work for a greedy phone company haha ( no worries LOL! When I see how much people have invested into monthly's across the board it boggles my mind especially since most people are just doing things like Facebook... ) so its not really an expense thing, More like a functionality question. More wondering if partner app will let me log in on a phone and tablet next to each other on the very slim chance I have to call a rider."
Tablets,jfinks,2769489,185747,"I use a 10"" tablet connected through bluetooth sharing to my phone. One thing that is kind of a pain is calling a rider. There is an app that shares numbers to the phone but I thought it was cumbersome and it isn't updated for 4 years or more. So what I have done instead is save all the numbers that get used for calling riders. You will find over time that about 10-12 numbers are always used. I save all these under one Uber contact, essentially they are all grouped under a contact name ""Uber"". Every once and a while a new number pops up and you have to group it. This has worked much better than pairing another app to both devices. So you run Uber Driver on tablet, and it isn't even installed on the phone.My interior picture needs updated because I now run it in Landscape mode. You have to use a rotation app to get it to landscape, but it works great like this."
Tablets,jedofarc,2769502,2769489,Awesome thanks I might give it a go sometime here because I bought a crap little prepaid and it's got a tiny screen. Lol
Tablets,jfinks,2769507,0,"Not true, 2 devices is much better, mainly because you can have a big tablet for Maps and Uber and leave the calling to the phone. I got a refurbished tablet for $200 and I don't need a second phone plan with it.In a pinch in case the tablet dies I can install the driver app on my phone and use it, but never had to. Be sure to get a high current dual cig lighter adapter. A lot are low current and can't keep up with the power draw."
Howdy All - Brand new Uber noob here.,,184080,0,
Howdy All - Brand new Uber noob here.,AGoofyMO,2739510,184080,Just signed up with Uber this week. I'm still working through the basics; attempting to understand the app and such. Any helpful tips for a new Uber dude?Thanks!AGoofyMO
Howdy All - Brand new Uber noob here.,arghcd,2740140,184080,I would advise you to only use the destination filter at the end of the night when you get out in gardner-Edgerton or grain valley (as examples) that way there's a shot you can make some money getting back to your neck of the woods in Lee's Summit. Don't even mess with Westport unless it's on the outskirts because lately they are making it a mess for pickups..Have fun and if you have specific questions about the app let me know and I will try to be of some assistance!
Howdy All - Brand new Uber noob here.,jfinks,2743713,2740140,So you are the one taking those gardner new century rides that I ignore. Lol
Howdy All - Brand new Uber noob here.,jfinks,2744364,2739510,"Leave the Harley at home. lolReally the app isn't that involved. Login and go online. Try out google maps and waze for navigation, the uber app navigation kinda sucks but it is ok for when you get toward the pickup. I get confused on left and right when driving South especially when trying to keep eyes on road, the uber app doesn't rotate, but Maps and Waze can rotate. I've been using Waze lately after starting out with Maps. I use the British guy to navigate, that way I blame it on the British guy if I make a wrong turn.At first you just need to take what pings. My simple rules are no more than 8-10 minutes to pickup or 2-4 miles. There are exceptions, if the pickup is in a high surge area take it. Use the no show to your advantage. 5 minutes and that is it. You are lucky, they just added a countdown timer in app, for a long time it wasn't available. If it is a high surge 2x plus I'd be calling the rider to make sure to get the ride.Clean car, don't wreck, if you make a wrong turn get back on track asap, and don't let more than 4 riders go into an uberX. Most riders will sit in the back but some will ask if it is ok to sit in front. If 4 riders you have no choice but 1 riding shotgun anyway.Don't chase the red surge unless you are very close. If you chase it 9 times out of 10 it will be gone when you get there."
Howdy All - Brand new Uber noob here.,Carnal Sanders,2756869,184080,Uber screwed me on surge. I was at Kauffman waiting for the area to change colors. I opted not to go wait for red but went online at orange. As soon as I went online I got a ride. When I dropped them off an hour later it was $20. Put in ticket uber insisted that I wasn't in a surge.
Howdy All - Brand new Uber noob here.,jfinks,2756946,2756869,"I don't do this, but some take screen caps to document the surge. It should say the surge x amount on the trip details page."
Howdy All - Brand new Uber noob here.,Carnal Sanders,2756988,184080,I was nearby. About ten minutes away so I decided to go knowing there would inevitably be a surge. I learned my lesson. I'll screen cap from now on. Total BS. Uber keeps insisting that there was no surge. I made it a point to go online once the surge was up.
Howdy All - Brand new Uber noob here.,jfinks,2757012,184080,"If it was a light surge it wouldn't have made much difference in pay, maybe 2-3 bucks. I wouldn't bother screen capping 1.3-1.6x surge. But if it gets over 1.6 and up to 3-4x or higher then I would document it."
Howdy All - Brand new Uber noob here.,jedofarc,2757674,184080,"So something I learned form talking to someone who rides a lot of Uber in a different city... and also works in IT, the Surge thing is tricky... he thinks and I think he's right that the surge is a combination of 2 things, potential riders loading the app in proportion to the number of nearby drives, but also known customer demand behavior in the area taken from historical data. That being said... when a would be rider puts in a location he or she is given a quote. If hypothetically the quote they are given and agree to was given when the surge was at say x1.3 their price would be such. As a driver you may be sitting there watching the surge intensify but your surge is tied to the price that they are given which is based on the time that actually requested a ride. There is a small window of delay between them getting a quote and you accepting. That could be all wrong of course but its what we like to think lol."

Airport,,159413,0,
Airport,zkunze97,2373551,159413,"So, I pull in the airport queue and I'm number 8? Supposedly. I checked the incoming flights. New York, Chicago, Atlanta. All big uber cities. 8 people and over an hour to get a ride. Am I missing something?"
Airport,Art Deco,2470511,159413,Are you by chance driving XL as well as X?
Airport,jfinks,2475514,159413,"There is no guarantee that enough on those planes need ubers. A lot rent cars, take taxis, hotel shuttles, have their own cars in lots already, friends/family picking them up...etc... An hour to get a ride is a little long, but not too bad. I limit my wait to about an hour if I find myself up at the airport because of dropping off. I never go to the airport just to find a ride, it is way out of the way for me and the wait and money you make isn't enough to justify it."
Airport,zkunze97,2478761,159413,"I drive select, plus x obviously. I understand alternate sources of transportation. But 180 seats on a flight. At least ten, which I feel is a small number, per flight should request an uber. Not to mention I've seen my queue go back up before... WTF. I live in Parkville so the airport is a good start for the day."
Airport,jfinks,2478790,159413,"Ya I agree, just no guarantees that ubers are being requested. I am wondering if the new Lot C staging location has anything to do with it. It takes 4x longer to get to the rider compared to the cell lot in the circle. That Lot C is way out there and another reason I don't go to the airport much.Ya if in Parkville I can see it I guess. I am way south and rarely make it up there."
Airport,that one girl,2496634,159413,"Wthahell I was at the cell area seen a couple people there don't know if they were uber or not, but where is lot C located at ?? I honestly thought the c stood for tha cell phone area no??...."
Airport,jfinks,2496878,159413,"There are 3 economy lots way north of the airport. A, B and C. You wont get any pings in the Cell lot, you have to be in Lot C to get in the queue."
Airport,cheapinkc,2497335,2496634,Follow the signs to Economy parking and from there go to Lot C.
Airport,jfinks,2498697,159413,"Ya, it is basically off the airport property. Pretty dumb, by the time you exit the lot you might as well hop on the highway to get back to the airport. Mexico City Blvd will get you there but it takes about 10 minutes now to get from lot to gate."
Airport,Detroit Dion,2509439,159413,I am coming thru town to head to Kansas.Is KCI(MCI) profitable?Here in Detroit the airport que can be as high as 54 but moves fast. Usually less than 40 minutes . It would seem airport runs would make money since the airport is away from the metro area.
Airport,jfinks,2509554,159413,Best thing to do is check the arrival schedule for the day. Problem can be whether it is worth it to wait 30-40 minutes in queue doing nothing vs driving in a more busy part of town. That one trip you get from the airport is worth 30 bucks or so depending on how far south it goes. Then are you going to dead head back up to the airport and wait in queue again?
Airport,Detroit Dion,2509567,159413,"Here, i get brought to the airport then i wait for another ride. We some time only get ten dollar rides from the airport. So if i got several rides to Johnson county they would be over 30$?"
Airport,jfinks,2510782,159413,"Depends on where in Johnson county, probably average 30 or so. The problem is being ""brought"" to the airport. It happens but maybe 1 in 20 to 30 rides, and that depends on time of day and day of week."
Airport,DiceyDan,2516808,159413,"The airport lately has been completely saturated, not sure if college students are back doing this, but I've noticed almost a 50% increase in cars/wait time. It is a gamble to wait, exactly what the last reply said, you may get rides to the hotels just off the airport property which could be as low as 3-5 dollars. It happened to me quite a few times."
Airport,jfinks,2517174,0,"Yep, and airport rides isn't just about Johnson County. That would suck to wait in queue for an hour then get a ride to a hotel 3 miles away. I don't work the airport much, but when I have it has always been rides far south, down town, or somewhere like Harrah's. Guess I've been lucky so far.DiceyDan said:The airport lately has been completely saturated, not sure if college students are back doing this, but I've noticed almost a 50% increase in cars/wait time.

Airport,5Yodas,2535936,159413,I've been sitting in lot C for over ten minutes and still no queue pop up? Am I missing something?
Airport,jfinks,2536285,2535936,Any luck? It should be automatic.
Airport,5Yodas,2536339,159413,Stayed for 40 minutes. Never saw the queue.I started in the cell lot. Waited about 15 minutes there. Uber sent me an info screen about moving to the C lot.
Airport,Scrad Man,2697158,2536339,"I have the same problem but I have a fix for you... Close the app (stay signed in) and reopen it. The queue should pop up. If not, try moving further back in the lot then try again.I'll often have to close and reopen the app to get the queue to appear, but you should only have to do it at the start. You'll be all good after that."
Airport,Qbranch,2759061,159413,MCI has been pretty good. I won't stop out there if more than 60 cars...but usually when 55 or less....usually about an hr wait. worth it instead of just driving around.
Airport,Carnal Sanders,2759696,2470511,I've waited there once and I'll never do it again. Queue said 11-20 cars. Two hours and nothing. I kept telling myself I was just going to leave but I then convinced myself that I was time committed since I've already spent so much time there. Never ended up getting a ride and I got to the gate a minute too late and had to pay two dollars for the ticket.I'm an XL does that mean anything?
Airport,jfinks,2761273,159413,Yes it matters a lot. There are probably over 100 x requests to each xl request. You would be much more likely to get a ride from a x request.
Airport,Carnal Sanders,2761486,2761273,Yea but XL get X requests too. The way they put it made it seem like XL had something to do with not getting requests.
Airport,jfinks,2761622,159413,Ya depends on time of day and day of week too. Check the arrivals at mci and see how many flights are coming in.
Airport,aw99,2764147,159413,"You loose by giving ride with xl with x rate money. Either way waiting so many hours at the airport doesn't make sense. No surge, usually $18 to downtown. Why waste there your time. I see a lot of desperation."
Airport,jfinks,2764232,2764147,If I give a ride up to the airport I generally will wait for a ride back. But first check the arrivals. If there are no planes scheduled for 2-3 hours then don't wait. This can happen in early mornings. and late nights. This also depends on how big the queue is and if there are any big surges going down town.

"Maybe I missed it - whats up with the ""P""?",UberRazor,2667664,179533,"Hey All,I was out-n-about last night and I continually noticed this P location flagged in OP - I did end up driving to the location and it was in one of Sprint's parking garages; on the western side of their campus.Is this new? I'd assume the P stands for parking? It showed a wait queue so I'm a bit confused - what is the queue for at this particular location?I appreciate any information, if you have it."
"Maybe I missed it - whats up with the ""P""?",NGOwner,2669154,179533,"Maybe Sprint got tired of all the Uber cars waiting in front of 6220 and the headquarters building and told Uber to set something up like the airport.If you want a Sprint pickup, you must be in that geozone to get one.NGOwner"
"Maybe I missed it - whats up with the ""P""?",jfinks,2669506,179533,"Ya saw it there last night, it is a queuing system like airport. Last night it said 1 car in queue. Guess my secret spot is out, always got some good rides out of Sprint. Not good enough to wait in a queue though."
"Maybe I missed it - whats up with the ""P""?",jedofarc,2691785,179533,Ive never seen the queue bigger than 1 or two though.
"Maybe I missed it - whats up with the ""P""?",jfinks,2691875,0,"Usually when I got a Sprint ride I was in the general area out on Metcalf/119th or Nall and got a request. This kinda sucks for Sprint employees cause I'm not gonna go sit and wait at Sprint, especially in a Queue. Most are Indians that live in the apartments over off of Metcalf so a lot are short trips. No not Native Americans. lol"
"Maybe I missed it - whats up with the ""P""?",UberRazor,2701479,2691875,"Unfortunately, I agree with you on this one. Yes, many Indians (obviously I don't care who I provide rides for) but I've also had many folks working on Campus from out of town as well and most everyone stays very close and/or lives close the Campus. I've only had 1 or 2 px from Sprint want to travel more than 20 mins to their destination. You won't find me sitting in the Spring queue anytime soon...I'll take my chances elsewhere."
"Maybe I missed it - whats up with the ""P""?",jfinks,2701541,179533,"Yep, the few I have talked to are short term contractors of about a year or so. They never buy a car or house because they could move again shortly. So they use Ubers from Sprint to home and to work. Nice enough people, however very short trips."
"Maybe I missed it - whats up with the ""P""?",jedofarc,2758506,179533,"So weird update on this... me thinks it may not work like its supposed to... or maybe I was secretly in the queue and didn't realize... but the other night had a drop off at the old folks home right around the corner form sprint and I saw there were 2 cars in queue (why people were piled up there I do not know, all I ever get is $3 trips to nearby hotels or apartments). But anyway I got back to back calls for sprint pickups while I wasn't even on the campus and I could see cars were in queue, so sorry cars waiting, I did not mean to steal your $3 fares to the Sheridan that is practically in walking distance."

Double Tip Tuesday,jedofarc,2756826,185122,Especially since its a Tuesday... if they had done this on a sat or something maybe but not for a Tuesday.
Double Tip Tuesday,jfinks,2756831,185122,Ya Tuesdays are slow. I might go out later in the evening. But still people gotta tip to get it doubled.

Do you ever call the rider before the trip?,,183021,0,
Do you ever call the rider before the trip?,JT21491,2722879,183021,I was out around midnight last night and got an alert for a ride that was 20 minutes away from me in Blue Springs. I figured driving 20 minutes to pick up someone and take them home from the bar for a $5 and then driving 20 minutes back wasn't worth it so I canceled. About 5 minutes later I get another alert from the same person so I know they were having a hard time finding a ride and I was the only person around.Should I have called the rider and explained the circumstances and asked them how far they're going?
Do you ever call the rider before the trip?,Yulli Yung,2722933,2722879,You cant call rider without accepting the trip.
Do you ever call the rider before the trip?,aw99,2722941,183021,In this case you could call and explain your situation why you don't want to drive 20 min. for $5 fare. I usually don't like calling ridres simply ignore the request.
Do you ever call the rider before the trip?,JT21491,2727851,0,"I guess I could have been a little more clear. I did accept the ride the first time. I realized it had the potential for a 45-60 minute round trip for me, for possibly a $5 fare. My question is, should I have called the rider first to find out how far they were going before I canceled?"
Do you ever call the rider before the trip?,aw99,2727921,183021,If you accepted the request you have to drive to pick the rider to avoid low rating by Uber. Uber doesn't want you to accept and cancel. You can call and ask to cancel you. If the rider is nice he /she will. One time a rider refused to cancel me because she knew it is benefiting me not her. So you can ask where they are going that you don't drive that far for few dollars. May be they will tip you for your troubles.

How to upload record check to Uber data site,aw99,2727515,182984,Go to Uber local office. They should upload it for you. They are slow. It took for me over a month to complete the process. They could do it faster for you.

Uber GPS,JT21491,2676465,180104,What's up with Uber GPS? Last night was horrible. It was giving me pick up locations that were 5-6 blocks away from where the rider was waiting. Driving directions was all messed up. The voice would tell me to turn left and the map showed to turn right.
Uber GPS,zkunze97,2682449,180104,Don't drink and Uber.

Uber GPS,JT21491,2690810,180104,Would I be better to select Google maps in my settings?
Uber GPS,jedofarc,2690870,180104,"I tried that but I could never get it to read over the speakers in my car, the integrated app also wouldn't orient itself based on the direction I was going which was annoying. But I'm sure if I spent more time with it I could figure it out but, it felt like Uber was making it as complicated as possible to use other options other than their own. If you have a second phone or GPS in your car you could def just plug the end place into it."
Uber GPS,jfinks,2690907,180104,"After abandoning Waze early on, I gave them another try a couple months ago. I'm a Wazer now. lol It has saved my hide a couple times cruising down SMP where it is easy to speed and not realize it and lots of little spots for cops to hide out and run radar."

He used to complain about the cost for service etc. I think it depends on what your issue is. If it winds up being small theres probably a lot of shops around that will handle no problem but I know on several occasions he went someplace not a dealership, left happy with money savings only to find that they didn't correctly diagnose the actual issue. I think he just takes back to dealer now to avoid the headaches of trying to save some money. His experience was kind of what kept me off of hybrid cars when I got my last one. Not that this is probably that helpful to you but just some thoughts/experiences."

Rider warning,reo47,2646948,178246,"Yesterday afternoon I got rider request from ""K"" at 6514 The Paseo in K.C.Mo. She got in car with large bags of dirty clothes. As usual I asked ""are you K?"" and she said yes. There was no destination for the trip but she said it's the laundromat around the corner but I want you to take us to Chipotles and the park after that.She guided me to the laundry abut 6 blocks away and I waited in the car 8 or 9 minutes for her to go in. We returned to her house and she put the Chipotles destination into the app. She then got into the car with two little kids from 1-3 years old. At that point I informed her politely and apologetically that I couldn't transport the toddlers without car seats for safety and legal reasons. She got very angry and pulled the kids from the car and yelled that all the other uber drivers take them and I just didn't want to take them (absolutely not true).I was about to end the trip when it showed cancelled by rider. My earnings showed $3.34 for the first short trip so I didn't worry much except I wasn't able to rate the trip.Now the 3.34 has been deducted by Uber because:""Wrong Rider Pick Up. This fare was adjusted following a report that the wrong rider was picked up. As a result, we are not able to process this fare. In the future please confirm your rider's identity before starting the trip.""I contacted Uber this morning with my story, but they sided with the rider.So... I just wanted to pass along and let you all know that ""K"" at 6514 Paseo K.C. may have found a way to gyp the system. Also wondering if you all do take unrestrained toddlers on trips."

With my hand over the app I say 'you are....' and let them say the name. I always say 'that's the password' and say something about it being for both our security. Never had anyone quibble and never had a false rider. Most appreciate and understand.As for the waiting in the laundromat etc I don't because unless it's 5.0X+ surge, it's not worth it. Here Uber pays pennies per minute for waiting time. Anything over a VERY quick in and out I tell them end ride and reorder. The 1* it might get me is worth the money I make on the next trip."

UberX is only really worth it for long trips that start close to where you are or 2x and up surge areas.

Things that make you go hmmm???,cheapinkc,2587299,0,Had a fare this evening from the airport. The rider was charged $36 by Uber. Based on what I was paid the old fair would have been ~$30. I honestly hate the justification Uber is giving for this that they will use the extra money to recruit more drivers and pay more guarantees. If there is extra money on the table I want it to go in my pocket.
Things that make you go hmmm???,jfinks,2587355,173998,"What they are doing is kind of like the scam in Office Space (or Superman) where they skim a little extra off each fare. They keep it a low amount, 4-5 bucks on a longer ride, so the rider doesn't notice much. It is still always far cheaper than a 10/10, taxi or Ztrip so they can't say much. Take that 4-5 bucks times millions of rides a day and it adds up to big time money. I am fine with guarantees if that is what they are going to do. I would like a guarantee of $100 a night if I stay online at least 4 hours and maintain a 90% acceptance rate. It can't be based on number of trips because that isn't under my control. More drivers? Hmm not sure that is needed, but as fast as drivers quit, I guess they have to keep adding."

After eating I flipped the app online and drove east a little then South on Nall. Light surge all the way.

Uber I am sure has all the data analytics to know what they typical movement is in the city. I have driven enough to get a pretty good idea just based on my fares. Can you imagine what access to data they have?

Your rider takes you to the extreme southeastern edge of KC. Good right? You get a decent fare. Life is good. Except your next ride takes you to extreme southwestern edge. And each ride after that is a series of 5 dollar fares that keeps you an hour away from home. So then you basically, out of frustration, turn your app off so you can head towards your set destination, home. But instead of being able to turn this feature on, to make a little extra money on your ride home, you leave your app off, out of fear your next rider will take you even further away from your destination.

I've heard that a new driver gets first dibs on a lot of good trips to kind of lure them in. It isn't a bonus or anything, but it makes you think it will always be like that."
1st week driving for taxi company,,148260,0,
1st week driving for taxi company,kcdrvr15,2211234,148260,"I've been an uber/lyft driver from the summer of 2015, after several fare cuts, saturation of too many drivers, and terrible customer support, I decided to start driving a taxi for a privately owned taxi company here in Johnson county. My first week, leased a 7 year old black town car and relied upon the company's ""dispatch system"" which was text and voice calls to get requests. My mentor, whom has been in the taxi business for about 10 years, has been honest and helpful with guiding me into this profession.I went to the KCI Police department and got my airport credentials, took about an hour, finger printed and photo for background check with the TSA. They gave me a handout that explains the procedure I would be using and gave me a print out of regulations to follow. I went to regulated industries and filled out the paper work for a ""livery"" permit as the company is considered a livery not taxi. I was coached and mentored in how to deal with the ""dispatch"" system, how to approach the desk clerks at the different hotels and how to quickly figure fares, as we don't have meters in the car. First day I made well over the weekly lease amount and was very encouraged, the passengers have been about like I experienced with uber and lyft, EXCEPT, I get tipped on almost every ride. About half the rides are cash, the rest are CC which I accept using the Square point of sale system. Fare structure is pretty close what we see posted on the sides of the standard yellow cabs running around town. This next week I will be introduced to some other ""dispatch"" systems being used by private cabs here in KC, these are subscriber based and unless you are leasing a vehicle from their company, you have to pay to play.My fuel costs went up, as this towncar doesn't get as good mileage as my other vehicle, (2016 subaru outback) but I should have the monies to pay my commercial insurance in full for six months in about a month. The skills learned in finding addresses, calling the passenger to verify pickup location, being personable and knowing when the rider wants to talk and when they don't are all the same with this service as they were with uber/lyft. I'm enjoying the work, and look forward to improving my business skills. Yes, it's more work, as I have to finish getting all the permits and inspections done to get my own taxi, but the lease option is sustainable and fare to both me and the owner.Because of the very competitive nature of the taxi/limo business, I won't be reveling any names or companies out of respect for those who have reached out to me and offered to help me learn how to be a successful taxi/limo driver. To all my friends up at lot c, thank you for the last couple of years, may you prosper and be blessed. And to Shelly B @ 909 walnut, no your dog is not welcome in my car... lol"
1st week driving for taxi company,arghcd,2212341,148260,"That sounds like a good gig, I bet the clientele probably will start to restore your faith in humanity. A couple days of uber just makes it hard to be around humans for a while. Receiving tips and sober passengers would be a ton more fun"
1st week driving for taxi company,kcdrvr15,2243590,148260,"I just dropped off an airport client at home, this was the last ride of my second week driving a licensed livery vehicle in Kansas City. I cleared a little over $700 net. this is minus the lease payment, fuel costs and some trips to office max for a nice business notebook and to keep my ride log in. I work mostly days, making myself available from 7am to around noon, then again from 2pm till 8pm, about half that time is spent sitting at home waiting for the dispatch system to match me up with a rider. I was able to book several rides on my own, previous riders calling back to book another ride, I always give them back to dispatch, as they may have a driver available thats closer, this had led the dispatchers giving me more rides and ""rewarding"" me with some very generous repeat clients that tip well. I had a ""charter"" ride that pays $60 an hour, drove a couple around town to different locations for two hours, waiting for them at each stop. Even picked up a couple from the sprint center, the taxi stand fellow saw my Johnson county taxi permits on the windows and told me to stay in line, and he would get me a fare to Johnson county.Saw another former Uber XL / Select suv driver this week in the limo lot, I was walking with my hat on, he recognized me and called out, we had a great chat. It's nice to know that there is life after fuber, one with some $ for the driver.There is plenty of people needing rides, the question is not how much, but who. Cheapness feeds on itself, price your service based on how you value it, don't be a slave. #DeleteUber"

1st week driving for taxi company,kcdrvr15,2396955,148260,"Well, heres my position after 4 weeks of driving private cab in Johnson County, After cab lease, fuel, food, car washes and airport fees ( $3 per pickup) I've netted $2600...I drove 6 days a week, and averaged 8 hours a day. Ive secured 4 new corp accounts for the dispatch system and met some very nice and generous riders. The towncar now has new brakes, battery, alignment, and a good used set of tires. at $2 a mile fare rate my average fare was $19 and average tip $5. Many of my riders have used uber, but told me not any more. My average airport run with tip was $60. Fuber can keep all the cheap riders, there are plenty of decent riders out there that don't mind paying $2 a mile. I have even picked up some handicap riders with wheel chairs, they always tip equal to fare. The best ride so far was a charter, @ $70 an hour, $210 with a $50 tip.#DeleteUber"

MCI Airport to KU,ruffles920,2253967,150900,if i'm available I can do it. But most of the time there is people waiting for rides.
MCI Airport to KU,AARRR,2254530,150900,"Cool, I just wasnt't sure if anyone would want to go that far and if it was even possible to operate in 2 different states."
MCI Airport to KU,jfinks,2292321,0,"Ya it isn't that far really. KC Uber covers all of KC metro east and west, and includes Leavenworth, Lawrence, Topeka and further south I believe.The only thing Uber drivers like better than a long trip is a long trip with Surge."
MCI Airport to KU,DKJ,2292425,150900,"Lawrence is on the verge of being to far. You will drive a long ways back to KC before getting another trip. I'm amazed that riders usually don't tip for these rides, and for all rides actually! I only drive when there is a high probabilty of surge. I have that option, since this is just money to pay for my car. Anybody who drives thinking they can make an income is fooling themselves. Uber is run by greedy bad people. I wish enough drivers would do a day without Uber. Show Uber they have to increase the rates and riders to tip for the ultra cheap ride!"
MCI Airport to KU,jfinks,2292500,150900,For me it would depend on how long I have been out already. If I've been out for several hours then I might not be too excited about a Lawrence trip. But if it is early on then would be game. It also depends on time of day and day of week. Lawrence is pretty busy with Uber though I never see it surge on the map. Maybe you have to be in Lawrence to see surges.
MCI Airport to KU,AARRR,2302645,150900,"So, how about to Topeka from the airport? That seems like it's really out of the way. Any luck getting that ride?"

I live in KC so someone else flipping the bill for that trip is fine by me.I've never worked Topeka, but did Lawrence a little one day on my way back from Topeka. I got a couple rides in Lawrence then headed back to KC via Hwy 10. Stupid thing is I got to about highway 7 and got a ping in Bonner springs for a ride.

questions about the business license and other paperwork,DKJ,987758,71064,I am fairly sure you get to keep all money made the first 30 days.

questions about the business license and other paperwork,thomas1955,1041075,71064,"Doesn't matter if you live in Kansas, you still need business lic, livery permit and regulated industries permit. KC Police are writing tickets now for not being in compliance. Saw a driver at airport terminal b last week get arrested and his car towed for not being in compliance with regulated industries. if you check, you will find that you also need a permit to pick up in Gladstone, Riverside, North KC. They are not enforcing this yet, but who wants to be the poor sap that gets his car impounded. If your using the app, and are not in compliance, they charge you with illegal taxi operation, fines can be over $1500, and suspension of any permits being applied for. The business lic is less than $20 and takes less than 20 min, the nice lady that works that office is very helpful and the process is really easy. The only thing that Kansas drivers don't have to get is a class e drivers lic ( what used to be called a chauffeurs permit) You also have to get your car inspected and turn in a DOT medical form to regulated industries.

When do you hit the start trip switch?,crazy916,2187116,0,Actually I wasn't being sarcastic. In SF long trips are not worth it. Those take you out of the city to lower rates and make the trip incentives harder to hit.
When do you hit the start trip switch?,beercan,2192331,2187116,"Not sure what a ""trip incentive"" is...here in KC, there's the time and the mileage, and that's what we're paid from. Also, how do you know if it's a long trip until you start the trip??? we don't know until we start the trip!!!"
When do you hit the start trip switch?,crazy916,2192410,2192331,Trip incentives are weekly quests as Uber likes to call them. They are normally around 65-75 trip for $200-250 or about 3.50 extra per trip. I start the trip as soon as I arrive if they complain when they get in the car I let them know that Uber will not charge them extra.

Lyft has started in Wichita and is signing up drivers for Topeka. I only drv lyft now, tips average $1 to $2 dollars per ride.

I only do this part time now, was full time driver for fuber 2 years, got tired of being cheated and lied to by company. This may be the reason why we get so many 'difficult' riders is they are also angry and tired of being 'cheated' by fuber, so they feel justified in making demands on the drivers and giving low ratings for any perceived issue in the service."

I had no patience to stay around downtown any longer and drove straight home. What's going on? Week after week there not much money to make. Decided not to waste gas and time and stayed home on Saturday and Sunday. The good thing I watched Super bowl the bad thing Atlanta lost and no money this weekend. How about you guys?
Slow Friday. What's Wrong with KC market?,NGOwner,2072743,139250,"That's been my experience as well. Business has tanked on the weekend.

No surges, but steady work.This morning (Monday) was bad too. Online as of 6AM in SoJoCo, and my first ping came at 7:10. Terrible.But stayed relatively busy until 1PM.

And it's not what you think.The cabbies I know will tell you business is normal.Maybe the rideshare side is just down, like it was last year, and year before. Jan thru March is just slow. That coupled with the large numbers of drvrs, equals less for each individual drvr, but more for fuber."
Slow Friday. What's Wrong with KC market?,Franzgruber,2082748,139250,"The rideshare side is down because of the continuous advertising uber does for drivers and there being an abnormal number of them. Demand hasn't slowed down, typically there are surges during normal times (but it's when drivers unusually stay home).I dropped a passenger at the airport today and there were 75 cars in the queue. I found one who was next in line (or so) and said the wait was more than three hours.There are drivers from airport who will go drive downtown plus the typical drivers, plus any drivers that are just starting, plus the normal part timers. That's where the huge supply comes from. This weekend it's supposed to be in the 70s, so we will see if that helps. If not, it's the number of drivers hands down."
Slow Friday. What's Wrong with KC market?,aw99,2085142,139250,It seems like ridesharing is like current oil market. The market is over supplied with drivers and demand not greatly increased. We drivers like oil producers are not making enough. Speculators still make money. So Uber never loses. Like speculators.

MCI waiting time,arghcd,2027557,136481,"2-4 minutes per car is fairly standard, I stay if it's around 40 cars or less, that way I don't waste mileage on the old vehicle"
MCI waiting time,aw99,2027573,136481,3 minutes per car is about 2 hours. The problem with that is you might wait there 2 hours for may be $18 ride to downtown. Yesterday I could have waited 3 hours. It just doesn't make sense to waste time at the airport.

Short rides that took 20 minutes to get 1-2 blocks. You'd make $3.75 and it would take 40 minutes but some riders at least tipped. I've driven about a dozen so far here in KC and got compliments but NO tips. They're sooooo cheap! I could never allow a driver to take me 10 miles for for $10 or $12 and not throw them a couple of bucks.
MCI waiting time,aw99,2045288,136481,Nowadays people are even demanding to put 8 people in 6 seats car. We are expected to do more for less. Back in days riders were nicer. They were tipping as well. It's getting frustrating. Let's hope something would change. Unless you want to take a nap at MCI you would not make a lot of money there.
MCI waiting time,MLH,2049222,136481,I look at the number in the queue if it is no more than 21-30 I will wait. Usually less than an hour wait time. Important factor is the time you get there. Late afternoon early evening and early morning around 5 or 6 is not bad.

You just need to work smarter...with ALL of the insurance loopholes, where YOU, the Uber driver is going to get screwed ($1000 deductible on the insurance that Uber provides) and do not let your insurance company know that you drive Uber. Driving Uber is like a ticking time bomb...it can be great when there are no problems, but once you have to file an insurance claim...then you realize that that $1000 deductible (2 or 3 weeks work for me) and the time that your car is getting fixed, you are down more like $2000...I began driving Uber almost 6 months ago...I know more now.

I have mostly driven in Lawrence and want to start in KC. Reading some scary stories here about making the money we wish to have and not seeing this happen for many in KC. I scope out the surges and also the driver app to see how many cars are out on the road. I see surges a lot in Kansas City on the weekends and figured that there was not enough drivers to handle all of the rides. I monitor the usual times during the day and or night for surges and they all seem to be consistent and I am talking weekends ONLY now. (I see dinner time surges mostly in OP, and night all from downtown to OP. I am assuming dinner surges can ne short rides unless they want to go downtown for example. But my deal is with the surges I see, and I would not drive for less than a 1.5 to a 2.0 for sure, is why are you guys saying the market is saturated with cars and the money is not all there? What do you guys average per hour in terms or rides? I am hearing around 1.5 an hour for rides and are your rides mostly short distances or long ones in the metro? I see a lot of up to 3.0 surges too on weekends. I figured you would get a lot of pings but granted surges can be shortlived too."
KC market flooded with drivers. And it's your fault.,beercan,1381703,1381452,"Just remember...because you see a high surge does not always mean there's a high number of requests...it may also mean that the Uber software is predicting a high number of riders...and wants to ""lure"" into those areas where riders are expected. Maybe before bar closing times in Westport as an example. I say that driving Uber is like fishing: Different places may be good at different times of the day. Weather and time of year can affect the riders. Friday was super busy...because of the storms and rain.Don't just rely on surge maps to decide when to drive...which is better: a 2x surge on a trip from Westport to maybe the Brookside area (4 miles) or a ride from downtown KC to Lawrence at no surge??? (I've only had 1 trip to Lawrence, so...) or downtown KC to the Stanley area in Johnson County. Usually high surges mean chaos: gridlock, people who have had too much to drink...my suggestion is to pick your schedule and be smart where you drive during that time.You need to get out and experience how it works, not just watching the ""heat maps"" on the app...but of course be careful...once you have an accident, you may not come back to Uber :^)"

If you happen to be in a surge area when it comes up great, but dont chase it.

KC market flooded with drivers. And it's your fault.,aw99,1776606,96014,It is a tricky situation. I always complain that I don't want to drive more than 10 minutes to pick up a rider. The solution to that is deploying more drivers. But more drivers means more competition and less money. You can not have just 50 drivers to run the whole city. To fix that the rate should be higher that drivers make more money with less driving. This week my car was at repair shop I took Uber twice and spent about $30. I would ask a friend to give me a ride if it were more expensive. It is hard to balance what would be perfect for both drivers and riders. So you can't say Uber should put a cap on the number of drivers. People want to make money like you do. So that's not going to happen. In the mean time drive smart. Don't go to the stadium and wait for the riders. Turn off your app and wait for surge Last time I saw so many drivers parked in the parking lot. How do you want to mske money at $0.80 rate without surge? Don't be tricked by Uber's 1.2 x booost.

The difference between 9 minutes and 10 minutes is about 5-10 cents. These deplorables that obviously have no math abilities can't figure that driving ten minutes costs like 50-70 cents in gas. Depending on actually how far and if it is part highway or not. So 12-15 minutes away a would be $.20 more. As long as it doesn't take you into the boonies it might be worth it to drive up to 15 minutes away. This rarely happens, maybe once per time out driving so just take the hit on time and try it out. A lot of times you drive 15 minutes out and they are going to a popular night spot so you can pick up new pax there and head out again with 0 pickup miles. It all averages out."

Any words of advice?,,130540,0,
Any words of advice?,UberKing777,1918723,130540,So I'm looking to move from charlotte nc out to KC. What's it like out there for uber? Out here one can make $100 in about 8-10 hours. Is that possible in kc? Please keep all of the cynical replies to a minimum.
Any words of advice?,NGOwner,1921773,130540,"I am presuming by ""make"" you're taking about gross. Meaning what Uber transfers to your bank account. With that caveat, depending on time of day and day of week, yes, that's possible. Without surge.This is based on my experience. According to Uber I've had 1335 rides from July to December. I started in July.6AM to 10AM M-Th is pretty good. Friday at this time is not as good as the rest of the week, likely because there're rarely airport runs in the AM.10AM - 2PM M-F is dead here. Nothing pings.3PM to 7PM M-F is pretty good.Weekends:Friday nights 6PM-2AM is steady, but lots of Downtown - Westport - Plaza runs. We just get a pittance for those runs (see below).Saturday nights from 6PM to 2AM is the best all around.Airport runs are where the money is. To/from southern Johnson County gross around $30. To/from the Plaza gross around $22. To/from downtown gross around $18. So, if you can get a few airport runs in that 8-10 hours, $100 is doable. But there always seems to be more Uber traffic heading to the airport than away from the airport. Rarely when I have an airport dropoff are there fewer than 25 cars waiting. Usually it's in the 35-65 range. Figure on 2-3 minutes per waiting vehicle at the airport. So, if there are 20 cars waiting, you'll wait, on average, between 40 and 60 minutes for your ping to come in.Beware of getting caught in the Downtown -- Westport -- Plaza pinball machine. Those are killers, as it takes time, and only grosses around $3-5 each ride. Sometimes it makes sense just to drive 10 miles away from that corridor just to get some (guaranteed) longer runs.Lastly, we have no destination filter for the ride home like other markets. Expect around 40% of your miles to be dead miles at the end of the day.Hope that's helpful.[NG]Owner"
Any words of advice?,Franzgruber,1922132,130540,Agree completely with this assessment.
Any words of advice?,Lrlaz,1932003,130540,Thanks! This is great advice. I'm really disappointed that Uber does not give KC drivers the option to set destination so we don't waste the miles going home. This is one of the parts I don't like about Uber. Anybody know why we don't have this option?Laz
Any words of advice?,jfinks,1936595,1921773,I like the Pinball machine.As long as there isn't silly heavy traffic downtown going from point to point is pretty easy. Ya they are all min fares but can usually do 5-6 of them in an hour and usually get one going far out of the downtown area at some point for a nice long trip back to OP or Leawood.Westport is always a sure bet to get some rides Fri and Sat. It is better when Colleges are in semester.

Per online hour rate wasn't anything to write home about, but I like driving and meeting pax so it isn't all bad.Some say McDs pays more, maybe, but you have to work when they say to. So if it pays a little less than fast food per hour I am still Ok with it. My day job is what I live off of, not Uber. Uber is just extra money to spend or toss into the stock market."

Happy NYE from Lawrence,EX_,1900673,1896070,"Yeah, it helps to know/research Uber before dedicating yourself to something like this. Find your absolute bottom line even as a part-timer.The Winter Warmup promotion has been a regular occurrence for a few years now, long before Uber was even introduced in Kansas City. Unfortunately, becauseeveryone/anyonecan sign up there's too much supply (drivers) and not enough demand (pax), basically killing off the incentive that surge pricing provides.At best, NYE should potentially discourage the less involved drivers and they'll quit. It'll balance itself out but we'll still make less."
Happy NYE from Lawrence,aw99,1901571,129331,Well I thought I was making some money last year. When I see my expenses and taxes it looks like the biggest winner is Uber. At this low rate and 20-25% Uber's fee it's very hard to make any money at all. So the question is why so many drivers are attracted to drive for almost nothing? I don't know. May be pure desperation. Honestly one thing what is good about this business is the fexibly of driving anytime. Other than that there is nothing nice about it. It is an illusion. I gave up.Happy new year guys.
Happy NYE from Lawrence,jfinks,1909864,0,On short trips it approaches 45% or so going to uber.
Happy NYE from Lawrence,aw99,1909953,129331,Yeah short trips are money maker for Uber. If Uber wanted to be fair it shouldn't take 45% cut for itself on those trips. I get so mad when I see less than $3 fare on short trips.
Happy NYE from Lawrence,jfinks,1909990,129331,Ya especially after driving up to 10 minutes just to pickup and usually having to wait for the rider. That is 15 minutes invested and you haven't even started the trip yet. I've set my personal pickup radius at 10 minutes or less. Any more and I ignore the request.

deactivated by uber,MzHarlow,1883164,111301,"It is actually ks/mo state law, and federal ADA law, if you are providing a public service to accommodate all service animals. You may require that the animal sits on a towel or blanket in your car, and you may require that your rider show appropriate ID for the animal (such as an identifying vest, and most service animals will have a photo ID that actually has the animal's registration information and states they are a service animal. Kinda looks like a driver's license.) Not only that, but Uber actually does state in their driver terms and conditions (very important to read when you're signing up for anything that pays) that they require their drivers to accommodate these animals. They can deactivate you for any reason, including failing to comply with the agreement that you signed when you signed up to be a driver. I work in the housing industry in Kansas, so I do know quite a bit about ADA compliancy and how far you're required to go for disabled persons. Saying ""no"" to that fare was illegal and you can get into serious trouble, and you can get into other trouble too if she finds this post and decides that it is upsetting to her or has caused undue emotional distress. Be careful what you say about people on the internet, especially from a business perspective.

deactivated by uber,Franzgruber,1884006,0,The worst part about this guys story is trying to say that this lady is trying to get drivers fired for simply wanting to get her dog in the car with her to help. Not all guidedogs have harnesses. I picked up a disabled veteran from the airport with a golden retriever who shed a TON. The dog didn't have a harness because the guy wasn't blind. He simply had severe injuries from a bomb going off when he was serving our country overseas and the dog helped him tote his luggage out to the car for him. It was the coolest thing. I profusely thanked him for his service and was glad to have to go to the car wash to vacuum my car. He even tipped me $10 which I tried to give back but he wouldn't take it. I'm just glad he didn't encounter this clown because he would have denied a ride to a disabled veteran. How sad that there are people in the world like this driver. I'm glad he's not driving anymore.

Question from a first time customer,aw99,1855319,126959,The app will estimate for you oneway so you can tell how much would be round trip. As for the type of car you would not know until you place your request. You can ask the same driver to pick you up again. I would not like to do that for 10 minutes trip. It is a waste of time. Also I could be far away by the tine you're ready to be picked up. Or tip your driver nicely to do a favor for you.
Question from a first time customer,aw99,1856520,126959,Since the fare even for SELECT rides is keep dropping drivers don't afford to provide the newest model cars. What you get is good used old cars. Don't expect late model luxury cars to choose from. So take whatever comes to you and be happy. Good luck and enjoy the show.

I won't accept a ping more than 10 minutes away.This week, I've had 2 Lyft passengers and 18 Uber passengers. Only the Lyft passengers tip regularly, I'd say that 40% do.NGOwner"

Chiefs game Thursday,aw99,1799752,122975,Not really. Ball parks are known for traffic jams and a lot of time you spend stuck in traffic. The best advice: don't go there and wait with your app on. There is no point to wait there for 2 or 3 hours for $.80 fare. Look for surge.
Chiefs game Thursday,reesespieces,1799760,122975,"Agreed, I just needed to know the process if I had a rider that was going there. Even after the game, I don't intend to go sit there. I suspect there will be plenty of other business about the city in Westport and the PnL"

How do you even find your pax in that mess?"
Chiefs game Thursday,aw99,1803993,122975,"That's why surge is needed. Drive smart. No surge, turn off your app. You would not make $400 at $0.80 rate."
Chiefs game Thursday,Franzgruber,1804217,1803993,There are so many idiots driving who turn on their apps. Usually the older foreign people.
Chiefs game Thursday,Franzgruber,1804225,1803865,Traffic really isn't bad if you take 70W. I had five trips with a 4.9 surge. Most were within 15 minutes but each were at least $60. Finding pax is easy. You call them and tell them to come to you. They were drunk and cold and ready to go.
Chiefs game Thursday,aw99,1804277,122975,Now it's up to us. We need to educate the less experienced drivers. When we canlet's use this forum and tell these drivers to turn off their app. There is no other way to make any money. No need to say the rate is so low and so many drivers on the street . Uber and Lyft prefer steady income without surge. For us it a road to bankruptcy without it.

UberXL & UberSelect Drivers - business volume,Gol4man,1664385,109087,Select only three to five during the week. Early morning in some areas you can maybe four. Busy weekends have had as many as seven.
UberXL & UberSelect Drivers - business volume,ten25,1664700,109087,Thanks for the information. I'm assuming you mean 3-5 per weekday and 7 per weekend day? Would have thought it was more than that... dang.Have you ever tried sitting at the airport?I've also been wondering how easy it is to get your account set up for XL and or Select only.
UberXL & UberSelect Drivers - business volume,Gol4man,1665368,109087,Airport. Select only mode. Midday it can vary from 30 minutes to 4 hours or more. Good average is 2 hours. Waiting is free. No car expenses. Sel pays way more. If back n town you sit and wait too. Guaranteed you will get a ride at MCI. NOT SO IN TOWN. Sprint Mci you take home about $75 for select but only about $50 for x. X rides at airport are much quicker only about an hour. It always depends on number of cars at airport. Pax app only shows 6 nearest cars to pointer. May be many more. Drag it around to see more. Zoom in. Sometimes there are car on top of cars. At airport you can only get a ride in parking lot or at gas station. You will miss a ride while driving to the gas station. You disappear as soon as you leave the parking lot gate to go get ticket renewed. Missed a sel ride yesterday when I got it as I left the lot to get renewed.

UberXL & UberSelect Drivers - business volume,UberRazor,1759742,109087,What are the rules/regs for car types to quality for select? I have a 2013 Honda Accord EXL. Wondering if that could fall within the classification.
UberXL & UberSelect Drivers - business volume,jfinks,1760112,1759742,"I doubt it, think it has to be a black car with black leather interior.

It was kind of hit or miss Monday and Tuesday, but did get a trip up to airport from South Overland park right when I was gonna quit Monday. Tuesday got a few, nothing big. Wednesday was steady, and got crazy about 11pm-1am. I quit because had to go out of town Thursday AM. I haven't been doing this long enough to say it was a 20% drop in rides."

I got one trip in Lawrence then filled up with cheap 1.76 gas. Drove 10hwy back and right when I got to 7 hwy I got a ping for Bonner. He was going to Lawrence so headed back there. Went offline for the rest of the time back to KC and to home. Ended up making about $25 total for 2 trips. More than I would have made sitting on my butt at home, but nothing to write home about lol."
Thanksgiving Week,UberRazor,1759733,120114,I can't speak for all of the days you mention as I only drive PT but on Tuesday morning it was really slow with the maps saturated with drivers. I was out Wednesday afternoon for 3-4 hours between 10 and 2 and was slammed straight while I was up near the airport (trips to airport only - the airport queue was huge and didn't want to wait for 60 drivers in queue) so i left MCI and kept getting pinged within 10 miles of MCI. Wasn't the most fruitful 4 hours but still made a few bucks. FYI - I'll normally wait it out at the airport if there's less than 40 in the queue; that usually translates to around an hour of wait time (depending on incoming flight schedule/time of day/night)
Thanksgiving Week,jfinks,1759933,120114,"Interesting thing about Topeka, is the per mile fare is 1.85. That is without surge or anything. I didn't drive cause was doing other things, but I looked up fares. I wonder since ""technically"" Topeka is not in KC area, that drivers still go to Topeka for airport runs. For giggles I looked up an airport run from Topeka to MCI, it was $120-160. I think shuttles are way less than that if I remember right, but you have to preschedule a shuttle at certain times."

Does the airport EVER surge?,beercan,1494101,0,Wow!!! good to know. Never seen it before. I figured that maybe Uber had made an agreement to never surge at the airport!
Does the airport EVER surge?,Tedgey,1515325,43034,If airport surge in Kansas City acts anything at all like airport surge in Los Angeles it's closely tied with the arrival schedule. There should be a website that has your airport's arrival schedule posted. I don't know how many drivers work your airport but here it takes maybe 6-8 planes landing in 15 minute window for any surge. If you get that frequency for an hour the surge might go up. Your patterns will be local but my guess is it's closely related to the number of arrivals.

Once Uber is more well known and people use it more frequently in other areas you'll be able to get rides outside of the main attraction areas frequently.I drove for a year in Phoenix when Uber X first started there and focused only on the night life.

Car not showing at airport,UberRVADriver,754723,55530,"Many airports have a ""geofence"" where you are not allowed to accept pings on airport property. This is probably why you don't see your car on the rider app at KCI. There's probably a designated waiting area nearby. At least that's the way things are here at our airport in Richmond, VA.

This occurred late, so even if you are the only driver on the airport, if you go past Paris street, and someone else shows up as an available driver anywhere else on the airport or in lot c, they will get the ride, because you are in the geofence area. After dropping off passenger, go to lot c, and wait, if you cruise the terminals you will not get a ride unless you are the only one up there at the airport.

You will not see your car symbol until arriving in the economy parking lot. While in the lot it will just show the nearest 6 cars to your position including yours. Drag the pin around the lot to see other cars in the lot. You have to zoom in. If you leave the lot to go pee your car will disappear until you get to the service station area. On way back to the lot it will disappear again until you get back. Other cities like SFO give you a count of the number of cars and expected wait times. Not here yet. As it is now no way to tell how long the sit us. TALK TO OTHER DRIVERS! Wait can be anywhere from 10 minutes to 5 or 6 hours for select.

I zoom in then drag the pin. As I move it more cars show up. It always shows the nearest 6 cars. I can count over twenty at the time I do it. It used to show just the six car that had been there the longest. This is the same as when you are downtown. It just shows the six closest cars which us what a passenger would want to know. A year ago it would show all the cars in c lot. Made it easy to count.Some cities have a queue count with average waiting time. it won't let me put in the url for an article on this.

What to expect as a new uber driver in KC.,frumpus,1289865,92066,You aren't doing anything wrong. This is just how it is I'm afraid. Uber isn't exactly honest about earnings.

I went from the starlight theatre clearout to lenexa, it was 23.3 miles at 10:30 at night and I only was paid 19.89.. not even 20 dollars for that ride and no tip either. that was a long ride and it was on a saturday night. so far I've only had 1 good paying fair and that was my first pickup ever.. after that it's been 5 or 7 some are even only 2 dollars.. haven't hit many surge's either.. Thanks for your reply."

You'll figure it out, and set up boundaries that won't bust you in the end, Good Luck!"

What to expect as a new uber driver in KC.,BostonTaxiDriver,1291423,92066,"$700 weekly or even $1,000 weekly, usually GROSS earnings at that, depends on market, luck, if you're driving X or Black or Select. Of course, the latter two categories charge more, so you could make more but I understand there's much competition there, too, and much sitting and waiting at times.Two years ago in some markets, when rstes were much higher, supposedly some drivers in some cities made $30-$45 hourly, gross earnings before all expenses -- regularly. It seems with rates dropping so low in most cities in the past one to to years, that one needs to have a strategy and only work surge hours and commuting hours. Usually 10 am to 2 pm weekdays are slow, even in my cab; many cities have less and lower surge than in the past. Plus, summer can be slow, especially July, in many cities.That's why there's so much turnover in drivers, with few veteran drivers. Too much wear and tear on the car, too many miles driven in a shift versus a taxi driver. Maybe consider a taxi shift where you put miles on their car, but shifts are often 12 hours.Good luck."
What to expect as a new uber driver in KC.,Lilly45,1292783,92066,"I'm uberX but, just worked a monday night and not one surge.. This is getting really ridiculous.. I made 16 bucks on one trip tonight from the royals game... All my my trips tonight besides that one was under 7 dollars a trip... I'm really starting to get concerned, because .. I'm driving 5 miles and making 5 dollars or less.. This is not even a dollars a mile. I really don't want to drive drunk kids around all night from the bars but.. it looks like I might have to because I'm not hitting any surge's at all.. I've had 1 surge in 3 days.. and that was my first day that I started driving for uber and not one surge sense then. I'm going to give it 1 full week and if it's 2 dollars here and 5 dollars there, I'm not going to keep driving for them because .. I'm spending 25 in gas a day and it is a lot of miles to put on my car for the little amount of money that I have made so far. So I'll just see how the rest of the week goes and then I'll make a decision.. Thanks for your input.. I really appreciate it"
What to expect as a new uber driver in KC.,ajlggb,1293509,92066,"The only way you make decent money with Uber is limiting your trips to surge only if possible. Assuming this isn't your only job, only do this during select times. I will only put in around 8 hours a week for bar rush and other events and can consistently pull in around 180-200 a week. However, if I tried putting in 20 hrs, I'd probably only make around $300 if I was lucky. It gets exponentially less per hour the more you work."
What to expect as a new uber driver in KC.,SafeT,1293552,92066,"You came to the FUber game way late. Open the passenger app and look at all of the uber cars. There is a noob like you on every corner now willing to work 8 hours for $5. FUber wants everyone to be a driver, they don't care if you make money. They even want to sucker you noobs into preditory car leases that you can't even afford working for Fuber."
What to expect as a new uber driver in KC.,Lilly45,1293898,1293509,"I believe you are right about driving only when there are surges.. I drove a group from the royals stadium and it was 20 miles I mady 16 bucks.. not even 1 dollar a mile. the rest of the night not one 10 dollars trip, all my trips were like 5 dollars and 2.36 it was horrible. I drove 7 trips last night and didn't even make 50 bucks and worked well over 6 hours.. not one surge. So I'm going to take your advice and only drive when there is a surge, I heard the best time to drive is thursday through saturday to get the most surges? is that true? I wonder what the deal is with the airport pickups? I would hate to drive all the way out to KCI and pick up a fare drive them all the to overland park Kansas for 20 bucks .. ? do you know anything about the airport runs? Any advice is very much appreciated.. Thank you"
What to expect as a new uber driver in KC.,Lilly45,1293925,1293552,"It does seem that all of my trips are 5 bucks or less . I've notices for every mile I drive a fare to their destination I'm making less then a dollar a mile.. I was going to give it a full week but.. I worked last night (Monday night) and it was horrible, I made 7 fares and didn't even make 50 bucks.. I think I'm only going to start working the surges. Also this was going to be a full time job for me BUT... so far there is NO way , I'm going to settle for driving all over KC all night long for less then 100 dollars a night , if I can't bring in at least hundred dollars .. I'm going to keep job searching and just do this on the weekends.. Besides I still have to get all those licences, the business licences the class e driver licence and a transport certificate.. at this point I don't know if it's worth that."
What to expect as a new uber driver in KC.,slm31u,1323717,92066,"The real money is in weekends and events. You shouldn't be driving all over KC unless you have calls taking you all over KC. I average $25 an hour and drive less that 200 miles a night and 7 hours or less. I think I drove 8 hours one night but that's because I was slammed all night and didn't want to stop driving. I ended up stopping while I was still busy because I was tired and it was 7am lol. ""I would hate to drive all the way out to KCI and pick up a fare drive them all the to overland park Kansas for 20 bucks"" this is how it is. Don't make special trips to KCI if you don't live in the area. If a fare takes you up that way then by all means see how many flights are coming in and how many drivers are up there. If its worth it then go for it. Otherwise it's not worth the trip. Don't drive all over trying to find fares. As you drive more you will start to learn where you pick up a lot. Stay near those places. I don't drive Fridays most weeks now because I put in the same hours as Saturday for half the pay. If you do drive Friday drive the dinner crowd and call it good. Saturday I don't start driving until between 8 and 10. I usually head straight for JoCo. I live in Leavenworth so I stay online the whole way down and many times don't make it to JoCo before I get a ride. If I do it's usually someone going to Westport or Downtown. You will learn to get strategic with it. Are you driving full time or part time?"
What to expect as a new uber driver in KC.,Uber8er,1323987,92066,"Lilly45about the only way to make uber work for you is to drive during surges. All markets are different so you are going to have to see what the best places are for that in your area. I generally earn about $2 for every mile I drive, surges for me have to be at least 2x or higher. I do allot of sitting around with app off and it's not for everyone but it's 2nd gig for me. I don't do it for fun like some people do, no one is going to fix my car when it breaks or buy me a new one when I need one. If you aren't making around $2/mile hang your keys up it ain't worth it."
What to expect as a new uber driver in KC.,slm31u,1324133,92066,Worth is honestly a personal choice for a driver. I do this as a second job so I don't rely on it. I have actually never checked to see my mileage rate because I don't care. I have a figure in mind each weekend that makes it worth it too me. I don't drive over 12 hours a weekend and I don't drive excessively unless I'm getting paid. I also get fantastic gas mileage so I make sure my costs are low. Some folks do this full time in which case the cost per mile might be more important to them. Some of us just do this for extra spending money. There is no hard line if you don't make X it's not worth it that works for all of us. I think once you get in your groove and find out what works best for you and what's worth it for you then all will be well. This will either be something you do or it won't. I honestly don't think our city supports Ubering full time. It's just my opinion but the demand doesn't seem consistent enough to me to make ends meet.
What to expect as a new uber driver in KC.,DiceyDan,1337167,92066,"I really don't think one can make this a full time gig. The longer you work and expose yourself to accept anything, the worse it pays. I experimented when I first started to accept all requests and it was NOTHING like uber advertised. I was taking around garbage people that abused the system (mcdonalds, gas station, etc) for 2.00 or less fares (after driving 10 minutes to pick them up). I personally feel like uber is a complete scam and they are laughing all the way to the bank."

What to expect as a new uber driver in KC.,frumpus,1340583,92066,"The last thing you want to do is drive out to the airport unless you have a pax going there. That's way too many dead miles. Plus, when you get to the airport and get in the queue you'll probably just be sitting there for 2 hours until it's your turn. Then you'll finally get that one ride that takes you far away from the airport. If you just consider the fare for those miles it seems like a fine idea, but consider the dead miles getting there and the two hours of sitting in your car, probably with the engine running if it's too hot/cold out, it's the road to bankruptcy.If you get a fare to the airport, then you can decide if it's worth sitting there for 2 hours."

Learn hotels and their checkout times. Talk to people. Desk clerks are amazing. Some still don't know how Uber works (that it's cheaper than a taxi). However, being cheaper from Overland Park to the airport helps them, even if the riders' company is paying.Be willing to consider than $10 routes can be good. I can get two or three of these an hour. That's $20-30 per hour.I read so many posts on Uber drivers before starting. Chasing the surge will cause you consternation. Make sensible decisions. Downtown is a popular destination for riders all over KC.A pet peeve... Westport. You need it to survive, but I try to educate as many as I can that walking a block or two away from the closed block of Westport helps us find you much faster.I think Power & Light can provide some rides better than the airport at times.Eliminate the dead mileage. Drop off. Stop and wait. I've made it from 143rd in south KC, progressively back to downtown where I got 5 routes in 90 minutes that totaled nearly $50. That's $35 per hour.Small victories.I've also had losses. Airport wasn't fruitful. Westport is a bust some times. Power and Light can have dead weekends.I haven't tried the Stadium.

What to expect as a new uber driver in KC.,beercan,1344690,0,"Hi. I guess now I'm a FORMER Uber driver...anyway you need to keep your eyes and ears open to get those good fares. Friday and Saturday nights after 9:00 (also from like 5-8 is good too--those folks have to go out to the bars). Also good is to cruise south Johnson County on weekday mornings from airport trips. I never wait at the airport, unless Uber sent me a text message that says to go the the staging area because there are only 6 or 8 cars waiting. My 2 best nights were the night of Kenny Chesney at Arrowhead and Buzz Beach Ball at Sporting Park, and then earlier in the Summer, Boulevardia in the West Bottoms. Events mean $$ but also headaches. My area for just ""fishing"" for fares was Westport-Plaza-Waldo and then south on Roe/Nall into S. Johnson County. I never stopped driving, except to eat, or pee at QT.Best week ever for pay (I started in February) $550. Without taking out my gas, insurance, car maintenance, car washes (I always kept my car clean)...I wish you well"

Westport is surging at 1.5 at 1:30 AM on a Saturday??Uber is really screwing over the drivers, they know we rely on surge to make any money. I was pretty much paying to drive for Uber tonight. We really need a rate increase if they are going to phase out surge."
surge,Kambam91,1146554,82449,"A night like this, I should have easily made 140 or so. I clocked off with 90. Ridiculous"

surge,spholmes,1166250,82449,Watched the app most of Friday night and didn't drive. Hardly any surges. I'm not driving drunk people around for normal rates.
surge,thomas1955,1168929,82449,"They didn't change the surge, just how it's displayed by cells instead of whole areas. There are just too many drivers logged on. Try this my friends, next time your online and not on a ride, do a ""surge check"" with your phone. On the top and bottom of each hour, log off the drivers app for 5 min, then check back with the riders app, if it doesn't start a surge, then not enough demand for the drivers online. It's only 5 min, if it's so busy you can't do it, then don't complain if its not surging. The surge algorithm is still in place, it's just been tweeked some by the use of stacked pings and a cap on how high it can surge during wx emergencies. But the key item is ""how many cars are available for a given area compared to how many riders are seeking rides"". We control the when the cars are available. Uber just facilitates the hookup with the rider, we control the car. As long as we continue to provide the resource at reduced rate, what incentive does Uber or the rider have to increase the rate ? We are all getting played by the surge."
surge,spholmes,1170205,82449,"Yes they did change it. A whole area would surge, now it's just a little spot. It does seem like there are a lot of idiot drivers out there now killing the surge. I only turn on the app when there is a surge."
surge,Anlyn,1172095,82449,"Well that explains why I didn't get it this weekend. There was so much going on. Festivals in Westport, crown center, concerts, etc. I didn't get a surge alert once. Thought I had to make 20 rides or something to qualify."

I just study both of the Uber apps.I think we all know Towntown/Westport are hot areas on Friday and Saturday night. If we all know that and all hangout there waiting for a surge it's will hurt the chances of a surge or the level of surge. Don't fight the system people.

What has happened istoo many drivers online.On top and bottom of each hour, go off line for 5 min or so, this may trigger a surge.Uber knows they are killing the surge by on boarding too many new drivers, and we don't have any solidarity to fight back.This is why no surges at the stadium anymore, you silly drivers are sitting there out side the stadium online. Go off line and then when it's surging 2+ go online and catch a ride."
surge,frumpus,1242942,82449,thomas you are so right but unfortunately preaching to the choir here. I think those of us who have found this forum get it by now.

surge,slm31u,1323680,82449,I agree with Thomas and FluxCharlie. On another note it should also be obvious that not every weekend in Westport is the same. Some weekends are packed and some are slow. Just because it surged all night last weekend doesn't mean it will next. Stop sitting in places you want to surge. Be close by but not in the immediate are if you are hoping to make it surge. I spend a lot of time at the Quiktrip on Westport road. It's usually close enough to get rides when it's surging but not close enough to kill the surge. Plus parking is no issue and I have a relatively clean bathroom to use.
surge,Uber8er,1323912,1323680,The quicktrip on Westport road is only about a mile a way from Westport. If everyone were to sit there or around the area with the app on you still aren't going to get any surges. Again the way to get surges is to turn off app til it starts to surge. Than it doesn't matter where you sit cause app is off.
surge,slm31u,1324118,82449,I don't disagree. I've just never tried that because I've never really had an issue with not getting surges. I don't have half the issues I see most folks talking about. As I started driving more I just figured out how to mostly be where I needed to be at the right time or to make the best of where I was.

Surges,,93383,0,
Surges,sb1979,1309829,93383,How do these surges work? Just signed up tpo drive and keep seeing stuff about surges and about looking for them on the app. When do these usually occur and how do you see it on the app? Also how does KCI work? Do you have to park in a specific spot when waiting to get a ride? On the rider app it appears theres usually some drivers posted at what appears to be the parking lots before KCI. Is this where you need to go or is this just where drivers go to BS.Any advice would be appreciated
Surges,slm31u,1323651,93383,"Surges usually (in my experience) show up on the weekend evenings or during events (concerts, games, festivals etc) If you would like to hit surge times plan to be available in the popular night time locations (downtown/Westport) on the weekends or near the stadiums at game end. Johnson county usually surges first on the weekends. It roughly starts around 10 and will fluctuate all evening from downtown Westport and Johnson county. To make the most of surges don't chase them. Start your night in an area you know will be surging shortly or wait in areas you know will surge shortly. If I end up in Westport after 2 am I won't drive around to find a fare I will part at the gas station and wait until I get a ride. It might or might not be surging. Usually at that time of night it is. The surges all depend on us and the demand in the area. If there are a lot of us and a medium request rate then it won't surge. If there are requests and not enough drivers it will start to surge. The darker the surge the higher the demand. Fair warning though you can single handedly lower the surge rate by driving into the area. This is why I say don't chance them. Well that and it's silly to waste gas. If you are a few miles away that's one thing but if you are in OP and it's surging downtown don't chase it. I hope that makes sense.As for KCI you need to park at the cell phone waiting lot for a pick up. They drop you in a que when you hit close to the lot. If you pull into the lot to the right you will run into other drivers. I normally don't wait more than 30 minutes for a ride but I also don't pick up there unless there a 5 or less other cars there. Use the rider app and scroll through the c lot to see how many cars are there. It's a big lot so you will have to move your pin around a bit to see how many cars are really there. I really wouldn't do an airport pick up unless you are in the area or haven't had a ride in over 30 minutes. I like to pick up after 4am on Sunday for a last minute $20 plus fare. The fares aren't normally super high from the airport and they don't surge so it's not really cost effective to drive a long distance to pick up there. I live close by so I generally start or end my night up there. I also recommend downloading the flightaware app so you can track incoming flights to KCI so you are not just shooting in the dark. If there are only 2 flights coming in a 6 cars waiting you probably won't get a ride until the next flight comes in.I hope all this helped."

Passengers pay more BC they're expecting a ""luxury"" vehicle. When they pay more than double the X rate, and a Honda, Nissan, or Chrysler shows up, they may think twice about ordering a select next time.

UberSELECT Vehicles not luxury in KC,RobD,1292427,1291100,"Uber Black is only in a few markets and what makes it different from Select is that the driver has a commercial license, the vehicle has commercial insurance, and it will be a black luxury vehicle. The official list of approved UberSELECT vehicles are all luxury vehicles (Mercedes, BMW, etc..) with leather interior. A Honda is not on that list. That's my beef."

Drive 9 - 15 min to pick up rider, then they are not where they dropped the pin, or they don't answer the phone, or they do and say they will be right down, but don't..... Saturday, was parked in NKC at the fountain, got a request from Park College, drove to pick up, waited,6- 7 min, drove around campus waited a few more, canceled rider no show. I've started doing this at 5 min, I don't call or text anymore, the app notifies them when I have arrived, if they can't get to my car in 5 min, then they can just request another ride. At least I got $4, canceled ride fee, if I picked them up, min ride, I would have got $2.48. Before the fare reduction, I would have called them and waited, but not anymore."

Pickup at river front park on front street,thomas1955,1230167,88222,"I went out this evening to do some rides on the 4th July, got a ping request for pickup at river front park, just after fireworks show was over, 4.8 surge, there was no way I could find to get down there, all the roads were blocked by emergency vehicles, exit only! Called rider and told them I couldn't pick them up, asked where they were going, and then canceled with other. Then I emailed uber csr, and their response was the normal clueless cut and paste. I was so pissed that I started home, the whole central part of the city was surging, got a couple of pings way up north in gladstone, didnt take em, just went home. What a let down, anyway did anyone get anything on how to pickup at river front park ? Did I miss it ? oh well it was only a min fare ride, so with the surge it would have still been less than $20. Now I know why there weren't very many drivers out, traffic was a pain, people running out into streets shooting off fireworks, and then the police have the parks and events shut down for exit traffic only. Next year I'm just staying home."
Pickup at river front park on front street,thomas1955,1230930,88222,"Received a reply from uber, they gave me the canceling fee ? WTH, I didn't ask for the fee, I was complaining about the lack of any procedure for driver to pick up riders at the park. Did anyone pickup riders at the riverfront park last night after the fireworks show ? How did you get in to the area ? I tried to get down to front street, but Grand was one way exiting traffic only, the ramps off I35 both north and south were closed by the police, couldn't get down to 5th street and try the back route across the railroad tracks as it was closed off too ? I bet uber lost lots of business last night because drivers couldn't get down to the park to pick up the riders. Only way I didn't try was to go down to the bridge by Harra's Casino and then get on front street from there, but no way was I driving 15 miles to pick up riders going from the park to downtown hotel, even at 4+ surge. Did anyone's ratings take a hit because of the surges ? All the hype to go out and make some money was just like the fireworks, flash, bang, and up in smoke."

Average Weekly Earning in KC?,avguste,1019866,74249,Hey allI am currently residing in Texas (Dallas/Ft Worth). I am strongly thinking about moving to Kansas City and was wondering what is the weekly average a driver for Uber and Lyft can earn.Thank you
Average Weekly Earning in KC?,thomas1955,1041058,74249,"You'll be doing good to do $500 a week, thats with approx 40 hours a week driving on app."
Average Weekly Earning in KC?,avguste,1041779,74249,"So with about 20, it would be about $250 per week..."
Average Weekly Earning in KC?,thomas1955,1048726,74249,"No. The KC market is borderline, not enough population density and everything spread out so that you have more unpaid or dead miles than you do paid miles. I've worked an avg of 30-40 hours a week and my earnings have been from around $100 to $700 weekly. I have had days just this last month where I went out in the morning around 7am and worked till 5 or 6pm, and only get 2 or 3 rides. KC is not a big city, it's not even a small city, it's several small towns that have grown together. The suburbs here don't produce a lot of rides and the ones they do produce are short and cheap, so that leaves you competing with the other drivers for the small market around hotels, casinos, conventions and airport. Airport que times can be and are normally around an hour or more waiting for your turn for the next request, and that's if the ""cheaters"" aren't getting them. I've spent 2 to 3 hours waiting for a ride back to the city from the airport, while riders are getting picked up by uber drivers that cheat the system by stealing your rider. I saw a young immigrant driver last week get arrested and his car towed for approaching passengers outside the terminal asking them if they were uber and that he would take them now or they can wait for their driver to show up.I'm sorry but I would not recommend driving for uber. I have met many of the uber drivers here in KC that are and were professional drivers with limo, car service and taxi experience and most of them have moved on due to the rate cuts.If you need part time work to supplement your income, uber is no longer a reliable option here in KC. You would do better part time with postmates or delivering pizza."
Average Weekly Earning in KC?,avguste,1055234,74249,What are you talking about when you say cheaters?I also would do both Uber and Lyft.
Average Weekly Earning in KC?,thomas1955,1062490,0,"The ""Cheaters"" are other ""uber"" drivers that cruise the terminals at KCI, then when they see a pax come out side and stand on the curb, looking at their phone, they approach them and ask "" are you waiting for an uber ? I'm uber and just dropped off, I can take you right now"". The pax is not wanting to wait the 6 to 8 min for the real uber driver to arrive, so they cancel and get in the car with the ""cheater"". These cheater drivers are cheating the drivers that are waiting their turn in que. I've taken pictures of them and sent to uber support, and complained to airport police about the illegal pickups. But this is still happening, especially during peak traffic times at the terminals.Lyft is no longer active in KC, and uber has reached driver saturation. The KC market is not like the bigger cities, just not enough demand to support full time drivers, average profitable trips per hour is 1, this not counting the charity rides uber gives us (min fare). I'm retired, not trying to pay rent or such with uber earnings, really feel sorry for those drivers that are busting their asses and eating their cars trying to make some monies. I've talked to drivers that are spending 12+ hours day in their cars trying to make their goal of $100 a day. Tips have improved some, but not enough to make it worth it, as soon as I find another gig to do, I'm done with this one. I started last spring, now after 2 fare cuts, I'm driving for half of what I started at, it's just not worth it."

Average Weekly Earning in KC?,thomas1955,1165236,74249,"Not trying to disrespect you new members, but if your doing $100 a day, how many hours are you in your car ? 10 to 12 hours in the car with app on to get $100 is not good. That's gross of $10 hour, take out your expenses and now we're at the min wage area. Pizza delivery pays more with mileage.Putting 200 plus miles a day on your car for $60 to $80 after fuel is not a good gig. The only way this will change is when drivers stop driving at these rates. And from looking at all the 'New Member"" posts, there's still lot's of drivers willing to drive for less than minimum wage."

1st night driving in KC,,85078,0,
1st night driving in KC,jasoncwrd2002,1185163,85078,So last night I ubered in KC. Had a job interview a little too the south of KC and decided to stick around and try it since uber sends out a text every weekend about it. (I live 2 hours west in junction city/Manhattan)Got into Metro KC area about 2:30 and was already logged in as I drove up on 35 so got 1st rider while still on 35. Picked them up and short little ride. Immediately got another ping which was going to power and light which is where I thought I would spend the majority of the night. Dropped him off and got next ping within a minute. This one took me to northern KC area. Dropped them off and got my next ping before I could make it a block away. This one took me to MCI. STArted back towards downtown and got another one that took me to the stadium and that's where it got fun.Didn't know about the gate 1 requirements so wasn't able to use it and had to pay the 12 bucks which was reimbursed. Ended up going there on another fare later on. That ordeal was a pain. Wish you could put a option to avoid that area.Rest of the night was spent going from boulevardia and plaza area. The zones they used in boulevardia would have been great but at like 11 they shut it off and it got crazy in that area. Had like 3 or 4 cancels between police directing me out of the area and I think they just found other rides.Ended up making about 140 bucks between 230 and 1130 when I left. Guess I should prob invest in the required documents so I can drive there again
1st night driving in KC,frumpus,1186488,85078,Kaufman is a real problem for us newer drivers. The Uber office in town has been out of the air freshener tags for like 3 weeks now. I've been lucky and not had any rides going there so far. If I do I'm just going to tell them what's up and that they should just request again and hope for a driver with the tag. I assume I can cancel it and not charge them. It sucks to have the dead miles getting to them but I don't want to deal with that mess at the stadium. Uber needs to get their shite together with regard to Kaufman.

Fares are gross total amounts, not net profit to the driver, or what you ""make"".Now subtract the ""booking/SRF"" fee at whatever Uber charges in your city ($1.25-$2.25 per ride) then subtract the 25% Uber charges the driver as a ""fee"" now subtract the vehicle operating expenses, normally about .28 for every mile you put on your car ""Ubering"" around town. You will drive one dead unpaid mile for every ""paid"" mile so that adds up quickly too.NO, you do not ""MAKE"" what Uber is advertising simply put. Uber gets up to 40% of the total ""fares"" the passengers pay.

I emailed support about it but got the usual troubleshooting suggestions. Did all that and still the same thing. I live in the Plaza/Westport area and can usually just turn it on in my living room. I generally drive the busiest times because I'm in one of the busier areas. But since the update yesterday I've noticed that not one surge area has showed up on my phone -- either on the partner app or the rider app. I was starting to think it was just my phone (iPhone 5s). Glad you said something too. The Royals game last night never showed a surge, and I've seen multiple ""No UberX Available"" banners on the rider app in this area (crazy -- never seen that before), and yet no surge on the partner app. Only yellow and orange throughout the city. I'd recommend sending them emails with screenshots (they love those). What type of phone are you using? Could be an issue with the OS.

Ugh. My experience today driving in Lawrence,ten25,614083,46301,"Recently I had noticed the rate in Lawrence is $1.65 per mile, as opposed to $1.00 per mile in Kansas City... fast forward to today. I wasn't getting many pings, so I figured, what the hell... today is as good a time as any to give Lawrence a shot.Long story short... I won't be going back to Lawrence (unless it's to drop someone off there!)2 out of 5 riders entered the wrong pickup address, the other 3 were not at their pin, I had to wait for 4/5 riders after arriving at their pickup location. I received a 6th ping but they cancelled as I was approaching the pickup location.Immediately after the 6th ping, I checked my rating and knew right away it was time to bail... I hadn't even left the city yet and my rating was getting trashed. My 365 day rating was 4.84, and was down to 4.81 after a few short hours. Before posting this I checked again and it is currently at 4.80...Screw that! Driving there seems like a swift route to deactivation. Nothing about my demeanor was different than normal, and all of the rides went pretty smoothly once they started. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary about the rides until the ratings started to come in.It's really a shame for drivers and Uber alike, it wasn't even prime time and the pings were coming in nearly as fast as I could take them.Really wish that Uber would switch to a pass/fail rating system... and if you select fail it should make you select a legitimate reason or ""other"" with a comment.Decided to take tonight off to let off some steam..."

7 Weeks of doing this - a Kansas City Perspective,KCKen,65050,5500,"So far, I am less than impressed. I have learned several things that are apparently common to UBER drivers. I also have a number of questions that I would appreciate answers to. If anybody on this thread can answer my questions, I would be most appreciative. In no particular order...1) Emails sent to UBER, usually, do not get answered (particularly if they are questions about the $20 per hour guarantee). Do others experience this (lack of response to emails)?2) The first time the $20 minimum was offered (last week), I had the following question: What if I get zero requests - do I still receive the $20 per hour if I was in the correct zone at the correct times? A driver is supposed to have an 80% ""acceptance rate"" -- in order to qualify for the $20 minimum. What if I get zero requests - what is my acceptance rate? Still no answer; I would appreciate anybody answering this question.3)UBER offered the $20 minimum a second time; this time on the two World Series nights of Tuesday & Wednesday. They did not dictate a specific zone in this offer of a $20 minimum (as they did the first time). If I was around the Kauffmann stadium and online ready to pick up riders, will I get paid the $20 minimum per hour?4) I have had 3 consecutive nights where I was in the Plaza / Westport / Power & Light area and received zero requests for a driver. This has also happened on various other nights. Has anybody else experienced this?5) I do this on top of my ""first job."" I am constantly driving all over the metro in conjunction with my ""first job."" I always have my IPhone online and ready to pick up a rider. Yet, zero requests come in. Johnson County, downtown KC, etc., etc. Do others experience this?6) Supposedly, according to videos I have seen on You Tube, I should be able to see any other drivers on my IPhone that are in the same area where I have parked. Yet, I never see the icon that any other drivers are in my area. Do others experience this? Can you see the icon indicating other UBER drivers are in the area?7) I have had no less than 10 requests come in that I responded to immediately. In all 10 cases, I received a ""rider has cancelled request"" within 1 to 2 minutes of my departing. Do others experience this? Is it folks downloading the app for the first time and testing it -- and then cancelling? I am puzzled why this happens so often.8) I drove 15 minutes to pick up a rider last evening. Upon arrival (which was 1 minute earlier than predicted), I found her getting into a taxi cab. When I called her cell, she lied and said, ""UBER never confirmed that a driver was coming."" 10 minutes later, I received the message: ""Rider has cancelled request."" This proved she lied as there would be nothing to cancel if UBER had not notified her that I was coming. What happens to these riders that waste my time and money? Does UBER have a way of punishing them and still pay me?I think that UBER is still so new to the KC area that we have not enough riders. Does anyone else believe this? Perhaps we have not reached a critical mass yet in KC? So far, I am losing money on this deal. I will see whether or not UBER actually pays me for those hours that were guaranteed to be paid at a minimum of $20 per hour. Does anyone know approx. how many drivers are in the KC metro area? Finally, in order to assure that I am not stood up again, I am thinking of calling those folks that request a driver to verify that, indeed, they really want an UBER driver and they really are at the address indicated. Does anyone else do this?"

If you have to have a buddy do a minimum fare and pay them the $4. It'll cost you a buck 60 but will keep you in compliance to get paid.

And you might also want to check into insurance (re your PERSONAL AUTO POLICY.)Most policies don't cover this type of activityand will cancel you and possible not pay if you were involved in an accident.Again, nutz to you if you haven't checked.Nobody is going to cover you rear end if you get in trouble either, for illegal activity. Or at least don't bank on it, particularly from Uber. There seems to be some driver fantasy that Uber is going to pay for their illegal activity. Unless I had that guarantee in writing I WOULD NOT BELIEVE it and would not believe that Uber would be stupid enough to give it anyway. They'd be in trouble if they did.I think you are probablygetting the picture."

7 Weeks of doing this - a Kansas City Perspective,Droosk,67345,5500,"1) I have never waited more than an hour or 2 for a satisfactory reply to an emailed question or issue, and only once received a form letter type reply.2) I'm not sure. Have not experienced a ""per hour"" incentive, only weekly/monthly ones.3) Usually the guarantees are anywhere within the service area of the city and suburbs (If you have them) its offered in. For example, the Phoenix incentive going on right now applies anywhere in the valley, from Avondale to Queen Creek. Not just in Phoenix.4 and 5) I don't drive in KC, so can't help.6) You cannot see other drivers on the drivers app, this has never been possible. You must use the rider app on your personal phone.7) When that happens to me (Though I've never seen it ""10 times""), it is usually the same person. I'll have my phone up and ready to call the next time it happens, and ask if they need help. This tends to make them stop as they don't expect that call.8) The first cancellation by a rider is always free. After that, any cancels that are 5 minutes after the request time will result in the fee being charged. I get 2-3 of these fees every week, so it DOES work."
7 Weeks of doing this - a Kansas City Perspective,Emmes,67375,5500,"1. Indianapolis Uber CSRs always respond to my emails. I emailed them at 4am this morning and received a response within 12 hours.2. No. Part of the guarantee is that you have to have (typically) at least ONE ride per hour to qualify for the guarantee. At least in Indy.3. You ARE signing up for these guarantees, right? Putting your name and clicking the location you will be driving? You should get a confirmation (take a screen shot).4. The longest I spend without ANY hits (and it doesn't happen often) is an hour. I go home and don't drive around. I have a honey spot I go to and wait there.5. It could just be a new area. Have a friend download the app, plug in your code, request a ride while you are there to make sure your phone is working properly.6. You CANNOT see other drivers on the Uber provided iPhone .. you must have Uber loaded (rider app) on your personal cell in order to see where other drivers are.7. Sometimes new riders do cancel a lot their first time. They don't always know how to use the app. It's never happened 10 out of 10 times to me, though I get a lot at 3am.8. You have the ability to cancel the fare as a ""no show"" and Uber will charge the rider if it is not their first ride.I would say you're thinking too much about it. Hang out downtown to start during the day/mid-day hours to see how that works out. Around 4-6pm is usually busy as well. Print some cards with your PROMO code on them and hand them out to businesses you frequent in your ""other job"".Watch where cabbies hang out .. other than the airport, which is a no-no here .. bus stations, train stations, hotels, bars, restaurants, college towns .. are all good places to get fares. Also, middle to upper class neighborhoods that might need a ride downtown or to the airport. Drop offs are allowed in Indy .. but I put my light away just in case.Good luck."

7 Weeks of doing this - a Kansas City Perspective,KC Uber Driver,75139,5500,"Any of you that think Uber support through email is satisfactory is living a pipe dream. I have been driving for Uber for 5 months and at first I made decent money before there price cuts/hiring of numerous drivers to KC Market. If I had questions about Uber operations or getting a vehicle activated I would get an email back within minutes to a few hours. If I had an issue or complaint about being paid correctly I would not event get a response back or a response days later by email. Uber is great for the rider and terrible for the driver.I would say in the past 2-3 weeks since the price cuts I have noticed way too many drivers available and not enough riders. If you run your numbers you at best can make $6-$8 per hour after all the Uber fees and your gas cost. If you are lucky and you a get a price surge you can make decent money but that rarely happens in KC. I went from making $120-$200 per night on weekends 3 months ago to barely scrapping up $50 last weekend and on Halloween night. There is no way you can make any money with $1.20 a mile and .25 cents per minute the current cost for riders. Cabs are $2.50 plus $2.10 per mile. There was no need for Uber to lower the rates. Almost every customer i had was satisfied paying the original rider rates of $1.75 per mile and $1 per minute for better service and nicer vehicles. Let me say this again, ""Uber is great for the rider and terrible for the driver!"""

I lost approximately BTW, on the day that I went to the (expensive) hotel suite to meet the UBER rep and turn in my phone, there were two ""executives"" from UBER that were sitting in the corner of the suite eating a gourmet lunch. I attempted to speak with them and they did not want to speak with me. There also 6 other drivers that were ""resigning"" from UBER during the short time I was there. Finally, there were at least 10 Somailians signing up to become UBER drivers while we were there.

First, please understand that we are a small multi national multi billion dollar corporation trying to squeak by in a Capitalist world. This is no easy task, and there comes a point where our drivers, who I am told are very satisfied, simply have to take one for the team. You see, we are still growing as a company. We have such costs as hiring a team of opposition researchers and journalists, with a million-dollar budget, to dig into the personal lives and backgrounds of media figures who report negatively about Uber in order to blackmail them into shutting their trap. We also have to spend enormous resources covering up our corporate culture of sexism and misogyny. As you can imagine, these costs are quite a strain when it comes to treating all of our drivers fairly. But we do have plans in the works. We are currently treating a small percentage of our drivers fairly. The reason is two-fold. One, it is great marketing to help us expand and at least appear moral. Two, it is a model for how we just might one day decide to treat the rest. That Uber fans, is a.... what's the word... Promise! Last but not the very least, there are gigantic bonuses we owe to our executives, including myself, to serve as continued incentive for, umm.... having continued incentive to... umm... keep the ship going in the right direction. I am sure you can conclude from these statements that Uber is a fantastic company, doing fantastic things, while creating a fantastic future for everyone on the planet except counties to poor to bother with.Yours truly,Travis Kalanick"

Thought it would be a decent way to make some extra money, which is why I posted that trying to figure out specifically what is going on. Some kind of SITREP on the current climate in KC. Sometimes companies cut consumer rates, but they do not impact the rates of the employees. Depending the industry, and the economic climate. An example of this would be a profitable company that can afford to lower cost a little, but not at the employee expense. Its rare, but does happen.So it was a simple question for a newbie. If anyone out there actually has a respectable response I am more than interested in reading them."

I've been driving for uber for over a year which means I am grandfathered in on the 20% that I pay to uber. You on the other hand pay 25% there is one thing that's bad for you. Next they cut rates to .77 cents a mile that's before even uber takes their 25% cut another terrible thing. Why you ask? If according to IRS it cost you 56 cents a mile to maintain your car (including gas and wear and tear on your car) so how in the hell are you going to pay your self. Uber said we are cutting rates so you can make more money that's a complete lie all that means your have to work more to make same money you were making spend double the amount of gas. So if you drive at regular rates all you'd be doing is making uber money, so what I do it's drive strictly on surge at least 2.5 surge. You do what your feel is right for you but uber it's just a scam anymore. All they care is about their riders you and me are just a number for them. Good luck to you."

7 Weeks of doing this - a Kansas City Perspective,Shamwow,923176,5500,"So I just read there is an IPO possibly for Uber? That makes sense now why they would cut what they pay. Thats what I was looking for, and thats all I need to know. Uber cuts what they pay, they attract less quality drivers, and eventually the newer competition will take their market share. I was actually looking forward to doing this until I came across countless (and still am reading them in a separate window) Uber driver postings about how its just not worth it anymore. I guess the better days for Uber drivers are over.I could be wrong because I havent even been approved to drive yet, but this many people who have or still drive for Uber can not be all wrong."

They say well I made a $100 yes you did but how much work did you do to make that going through every pothole in your city risking getting in a wreck and you just put 150 miles in your car to make that. Trust me it's better to get a minimum wage at Walmart( and I hate that place) than work for uber.

7 Weeks of doing this - a Kansas City Perspective,Aha,923458,5500,Good luck to you. Don't pick up trips that are to far from you otherwise you gonna rack up lots of miles in car. My rule of thumb is no further than 6 minutes from me unless big surge
7 Weeks of doing this - a Kansas City Perspective,UberJC,946780,0,"I am a little concerned about why you think that UberX is garbage. I am cross dispatched for X and Select. But most of my rides have been X. I have received 1 Select ride. Also won't your acceptance rate fall if refuse UberX rides? Just curious. For me, i am doing this as i don't want to draw unemployment. I was laid off from my FT job from Ericsson I was a project manager and i need to accept rides to bring income into the home to survive."
7 Weeks of doing this - a Kansas City Perspective,UTX1,946804,946780,"Kudos to you for pulling your own weight.In years past, I've also not drawn unemployment pay by choiceand figured out another way to bridge the gaps and make it through.Makes a good argument for not becoming too comfortable with any joband to either have a side venture of some sort, or a PT gig that can bescaled up into a survival income, if the need ever arises.When everything else you've tried fails and you've run out of time and options,that's when the unemployment option is still on the table, but I'd consider itonly as a last resort and probably not then because I'd rather be working.Anyway, hope you find a cool FT gig in KC !(but keep an ace in the hole, uber or whatever)"
7 Weeks of doing this - a Kansas City Perspective,Aha,948649,5500,"UberJCFirst let me say I'm sorry to hear you lost your job.I don't want to repeat myself but from what I've said in a previous post; the cost of gas,car maintenance and depreciation is ¢54/mile that's according to IRS guidelines. If uber only charges pax ¢85/mile this is before uber takes their cut which is 25% if you signed up recently or 20% if you've signed up before. Let's say uber takes ¢17 and that's calculated at 20% than you're left with ¢68a mile, now take off ¢54 cents that goes towards your car you can figure the math after this what goes to pay you??? You also get per minute charge which is another crap pay at only 15¢ a minute or $9/Hr uber has to take cut in that. You can do the math from here and you tell me if uber x it's not garbage. I was only doing select only for awhile till uber got smart and started sending emails to everyone me included to disable account for cancelling to many x rides. So while acceptance rate remained 100% we were doing cancellations that uber wasn't counting against us until passengers started complaining because it was happening allot especially after fares got cut. I'm not depended on this job would never allow it to be so I'm strictly driving on high surges don't know how surges are in KC now but in Cleveland they are great I'm always picking up passengers 2.0x-6.5 x. I only drive twice or once a week not to often. Honestly you'd be better off collecting unemployment till you find something stable than doing this crap."
7 Weeks of doing this - a Kansas City Perspective,Aha,948721,5500,UberJCyou could also go to uber local office and see if they could get you on uber select only and an uber select/ x account to log on when surge it's high and it's worth doing x at the right price. I don't know how many select riders you'll get in KC. Uber it's trial and error and see what works best for you.
7 Weeks of doing this - a Kansas City Perspective,UberJC,949362,5500,""" I'm not depended on this job would never allow it to be so I'm strictly driving on high surges""It must be nice not to be dependent on the Uber Job. And not allowing it to be is not a choice for me. I don't understand that statement. Cleveland is definitely a different market then Kansas City so until you drive in this market please refrain from making comments to that effect. And if uber is gouging us with their fees they shouldn't market to us as if it the best thing since sliced bread. Not trying to be harsh he but you need to take a walk in someone else's shoes. Sorry for my rant."
7 Weeks of doing this - a Kansas City Perspective,Aha,949619,5500,"UberJClisten you asked for an opinion, you asked me why uber x prices are garbage. I'm shooting you straight as if I thought you didn't know much about uber. There is still many people that drive on the slashed prices and that's a disservice not only to yourself but to the rest of us that are trying to play uber rather than let uber play us. ""In other words turn off app when not surging is only fair to everyone "". I don't know why you took offense to it or expect me to be on someone else shoes. I never drove in KC only started driving in Cleveland since I moved here a year ago. I broke it down to you very simply on why it sucks and that you basically are borrowing against your car to make money, now that's OK if you are in a bind but I wouldn't recommend it. Prices in Cleveland are even lower than what they are in KC. Maybe you guys don't see the surges we do up here. If you don't than do yourself a favor and find you an alternate way for income. Here is a question you need to all ask yourself what would you do if uber wasn't around? It hasn't been around very long. You guys act as if this is the lifeline..."
7 Weeks of doing this - a Kansas City Perspective,UberJC,951169,5500,I see your point. I would say its one of the lifelines. If i could clarify... its more if a bridge to my next full time job. Sometimes the tone gets lost in the translation. I just dont like refusing calls as i see it as an opportunity to get a fare because you can't know ahead if time what your fare is going to be. However i have taken some advice from the Rideshareguy youtube channel on how far should drive to a fare my limit is about 6-8 minutes away and that seems to work. Also working out.of the airport in our area seems to work as well. Thank you for the input though. As for select my car is nice but not that nice my Suzuki Kizashi SLS is part if their Spor Luxury model i couls park it next to an IS 250 and they look quite simular. Just sayin. Thanks again

"winter discounts expired 29 Feb, so why rates still down 15%",KMANDERSON,888757,0,Cause the only way there going to make money is for you to give more rides.notice they raised the safe riders fee.If you goal is to make 200 dollars if they raised rates it would be easier for you to do that.You would take less trips to do that.Less trip means less safe riders fee.

is it worth it?,dgambill,772966,57038,"I'm in need of a new car, but can't really afford to take on the payment. I was thinking about using Uber as a way to pay for the car and my student loans. I would be able to drive in the evenings and every other weekend. Doing this, would it be very probable that I would make at least $1000 monthly after expenses? Thank you for any input, positive or negative."
is it worth it?,thomas1955,773164,57038,"Not at the current rates, DON'T TRUST F_UBER ON HOW MUCH YOU WILL MAKE. I started driving in May last year, I do anywhere from 40 to 50 hours a week, yea you could make enough full time to pay for your car and expenses, and if your really good at keeping your dead miles down, you would only put 50+ thousand miles on your new car each year. Plus your way down south, that's a lot of dead miles to come into the city and go home. I'm retired, I can afford to drive when the rates (.85 mile - uber 25% (thats .21 a mile) leaves you with = .64 cents a mile.... now minus your cost and since your making a car payment in addition to fuel, insurance, maintance, for brevity lets just use the IRS cost basis of .56 cents a mile (correct me guys is this the 2015 rate ?) leaves you with .64 - .56 = .08 cents a mile PROFIT, this is what your pay is..... WTF why am I still driving.....To day I did a total of 9 trips over a 10 hour day and I passed on several that were more than 6 min away. I went off line twice, for about 8 hours total online. My total share of earnings...$38.63Now costs, didn't track mileage today, $4 for car wash and vacume, $12 top off tank with gas ($1.50 gallon, $4 for coffee and a snack, that's $18 in costs,this leaves $20.63 for over 8 hours of ""work""....that's just above minimum wage in 1977 ! And that doesn't include insurance and maintenance.My advice to anyone considering buying a car and using it to pay off both your car and student loans, go get a 2 year old car, then get a job driving pizza delivery ($15 to $18 hour plus tips) and use that money to start paying off your student loans and car payment.I already owned my car (2015 Subaru Forester, 25MPG average) and have the resources to carry me over this bull#[email protected]rate issue. But even I will have to stop driving F-uber if the current situation doesn't change. Personally, IMO, I don't think F-uber will last long, too much bad Karma. BUT I also think that another company will get it right, good service, fair pricing, and recognize the importance of the driver in this market.I started this gig back in May of last year and want to thank the many drivers I met at the airport, hotels and stadium that offered suggestions and helped me to increase my earnings and get more riders. I retired from a high earning aviation career, and really never gave it a thought about how the livery business works, you drivers are all under paid and under appreciated for the service you provide our community."
is it worth it?,dgambill,776297,57038,So I take it that tips are pretty nonexistent as well.
is it worth it?,grams777,776328,57038,"With your city at .85 per paid mile, there's not much use in it. Riders across Uber are mostly immunized against giving tips. Almost any job that pays at least a minimum wage will be better since you're not burning through thousands of car miles in exchange for it.Taking it a step further, it might even be more financially beneficial for you to use Uber as a rider compared to what your car ownership expenses would be."
is it worth it?,dgambill,782273,0,"My daily commute from Belton to the Sprint Campus in Overland Park is about 60 miles round trip. I usually work 6 days a week. Something tells me that using Uber as a rider would not be financially beneficial at all. Plus, I leave the house about 5:00 every morning, that's probably a tough time to catch a ride from suburb to suburb."
is it worth it?,grams777,782732,782273,"Probably not in that case. The main concept, however, is not to do something based on the assumption that doing uber will help pay for it. Many have done so at great economic harm."
is it worth it?,SouthKC,787511,0,"Yep. I would guess 3 percent of all riders tip, which makes most of them cheap by any standard."

I see a lot of negative thoughts, but I have watched forums for other things and its a place to vent? SO do we have a balancing positive thought process on this Forum?I see that the intro pack mentions Kansas so we are doing fares in Kansas both originating/destination?

Whats the deal with with new Compliance Requirement?,CanOfWorms,735159,0,It would never be advisable to use this as a full time job. There isn't a hiring cap so new drivers just come on every day. So the market gets over saturated and everybody fights for work. Uber can also change the rate at any time as you have seen. Be glad you're not in Detroit. They are currently at $0.30 a mile! The only way they can make any money that is worth making is by doing guaranteed hourly pay. Uber can also deactivate you for no reason at all really. If your rating drops below a certain threshold you will be deactivated. And the problem is riders don't always give you 5 stars because they just don't really understand how the rating system works.
Whats the deal with with new Compliance Requirement?,v_n9netechguru,798494,50810,My advised is to pick a certain area to drive in and a certain when you know surge pricing will happen. Beyond that you really wont make a lot of money. Ive been driving for Uber for 2 months and I have been extremely lucky mainly because I only do it part time and I pick certain areas at certain times. I might work 14 hours in a weekend and make close to $300. But keep in mind that during busy hours and surge pricing. If you do this full time i would go on strike or something because this is bullshit what they are doing. $64 Billion Dollar Company and you pay your drivers like shit.

SRF jumps in Kansas City from $1 to $1.90.....thoughts?,ten25,587533,40327,I forgot to add the fare in your example would be a $9.10 fare with the old safe ride fee - so $8.10 * 80% = $6.48 ... or $6.08 if you multiply by .75I am still getting 80% what's the deal with 75%?
SRF jumps in Kansas City from $1 to $1.90.....thoughts?,John-e,658453,40327,"I saw and calculated somewhere that it was not 75% not 80%, but I have seen the 3.20 stay the same. I'll have to double check the minimum fares to verify that its still 3.20I have noticed that they seem to always be charging the per minute rate in addition to the per mile rate. Despite speed.Actually, I'm kinda confused today. When does the minimum get met? I did an 8 minute ride 1.8 miles and the fair was 4.58 -- with a $4 minimum, we never hit that with miles and time combined. Oh well. I gotta run."
SRF jumps in Kansas City from $1 to $1.90.....thoughts?,ten25,658655,40327,"I have since found out the 75% is for new partners and 80% is for partners who signed up before September something this year (forget the day, I think it was the 15th?)The base fare is $1.50 in Kansas City, $0.18 per minute and $1.00 per mile are added to the base fare, plus 1.90 for the safe rider fee goes to Uber. If those add up to less than or equal to $5.90 you have yourself a min fare - which means the actual fare is $4.00 after Uber takes out the safe rider fee... and you get 75% or 80% depending on when you signed up as a partner."

SRF jumps in Kansas City from $1 to $1.90.....thoughts?,jolly,664280,40327,"The increase in SRF looms large if you do a large amount of trips at minimum or slightly above. I did 12 $5.00 to 7.00 trips the other day, and after the $24 SRF was taken out along with there 20%, I wound up making about $40 in 5 hours. Taking fewer, longer trips is more fiscally sound; ie. 3 $30 trips to the airport in the early A.M. nets me about $67 in half the time. Uber is getting greedy with this increase and what is SRF anyway? Maybe RIDERS should pay it! Speaking of greedy....... I was told by a rider I've had on several occasions, who knows an Uber exec, that there are almost 2000 drivers in Kansas City now! Can anybody confirm or refute this? I've been driving now for about 7 months, and have over 1000 trips driving part time, and had never received any complaints about Uber... just high praise for the service, until about 2 months ago. Since then I've received no less than 4 serious concerns about how the service has dramatically gone downhill. Drivers who can't speak English very well, who don't know where the hell they're going, rude service( one rider told me about a driver cussing him out over the phone in broken English because the driver couldn't find him!!!! The consensus seems to be that Uber is hiring any and all riff raff that walks in off the street, and that scores of taxi drivers are coming to work because they're not making as much driving a cab. This is pissing Uber customers off royally, since most have horror stories about their cabbie experiences, and use us because of the friendly, efficient service that used to be our trademark. I have just received a request for a year end review of my Uber experience, and I intend to bring this up, unless any, more experienced drivers advise me not to, for fear of putting my job in jeopardy. Have any other drivers experienced this rising sentiment in riders ? It explains a lot, like getting 3 or 4 rides in a 6 hour period."

SRF jumps in Kansas City from $1 to $1.90.....thoughts?,jolly,667450,666692,"What??!! It sure seems like it's coming out of my pocket, since that $1.90 comes right off the top of each fare, before Uber takes it's 20%. How do you figure it's not coming out of our pocket??!! It really has a profound financial impact if you do a high number of short runs. Any comments on the other part of my post(the influx of drivers who may not be as quality minded and service oriented, that I have heard complaints from riders about)? Also............ can any of the more experienced drivers tell me how, with 47 out of 51 5 star ratings, I wound up with a 4.64 rating this week? What? Did someone give me 1 star and it brought everything down so significantly? Thanks for any feedback."
SRF jumps in Kansas City from $1 to $1.90.....thoughts?,ten25,667470,667450,"It's actually pretty simple - on a minimum fare in Kansas City the fare after Uber takes out the safe rides fee is $4.00 ... we get $3.20 or $3.00 of that depending on whether you are on the 80% or 75% payout structure.Uber charges the $1.90 on top of the $4.00 fare to the rider making the minimum fare $5.90 ... if they stopped charging the safe rides fee we would still get $3.20 or $3.00 if the minimum fare was $4.00 ... if they kept the minimum fare at $5.90 then yes - you could say it's coming out of our pocket, however when the minimum fare used to be $5.00 the safe ride fee was $1.00 so it appears the minimum fare is directly tied to how much the safe rides fee is.I do think the fee is BS for the record... min fare for us should be the $5.90 and no safe rider fee... our cut on a min fare of $3.20 / $3.00 is too low especially if you factor in time driving to the passenger / waiting and they usually don't tip."

This way the impact on ficals for uber were minimum, while we the partners get screwed. I've started only accepting rides if they are less than 5 min away and the riders rating is 4.8 or higher. I don't accept the ride, just let it pass and then go offline for 5 min. I don't see the fares going back up unless we can put some pressure on regulated industries to set the fares, this may be the reason fares haven't dropped in NY and some other cites because these cities have set the fares for taxi cabs, limos, and ubers."

Need to rant...,,44433,0,
Need to rant...,KCHammertime,586854,44433,"So I am fairly veteran driver in KC. Been driving for a year now and been very happy up until the last couple weeks.With exception of the big events here in KC, my earnings are significantly down. This weekend has just been horrific. I averaged just under $10/hr. I think Uber has way over-recruited drivers, diluting the earnings of existing drivers. Just some thoughts:-Downtown surged last night to 2.8x. I was there when it started at 1.5x -> 2.1x -> 2.8x. I sat near P&L, despite Grand and surrounding streets being closed, for over 25 minutes with NO trip requests. When checking nearby drivers, the entire area was flooded with other UberX's. I am not sure why it was surging, as plenty of cars were available. Maybe this was a ""gimme"" from Uber considering nothing surged Friday night until almost midnight.-There are 22 (yes, 22!) UberX's at the airport right now as I write this.-Add in another 3 drivers who have been circling terminal B/C for the last 15 minutes. WTG guys, you're gonna get our airport privileges yanked!-It's funny to watch the same 5-10 drivers who chase 1.5x surge between Westport and Downtown. These folks have a lack of understanding what they're doing and why they're not only hurting their own earnings, but those of other drivers.-What's with all the canceled trips recently? I had 4 last night.-EDIT: Add one more. I am tired of writing in to our support team here only to get a canned response that does not address the issue I wrote about. I feel like they don't even read my email."

Need to rant...,jrel,588340,44433,Haha welcome to the real Uber my friend. Be glad you make $10an hour. Where I live in South Florida is a small 7x7 mile city and there are anywhere from 12-17 drivers so I moved down the street where there are 3-5 in the next city over. Do not expect to make tons of money at this game ir you will go postal. It is a part time money maker and nothing more. I am originally from KC so I can imagine how hard it would be to make good money there compared to Miami and Ft Lauderdale. It is a gritty job but no where else can you make your own hours and work where you want for as long as you want.
Need to rant...,SouthKC,592178,44433,"I may have been sheltered as well, but I had 4 consecutive trips cancelled tonight.And, I completely agree that Uber has WAY over-recruited here. Tuesday night, I got 4 rides in 7 hours. I was next to the P&L twice during surge and still nothing, waiting at one time around 35 minutes. When I look at the rider map, there are cars everywhere. Yesterday, on a Monday, there were probably 12 cars around southern JOCO area, an area that probably has below average demand.If this keeps up, I won't be doing this much longer."

If you want me to wait for the surge to go away, I might as well go home.I don't game it by turning off till there is a surge, but if I am around, and there are tons of people just sitting around waiting for surge to end {Yea, the steps are full of people sitting around twiddling their thumbs} I'll just turn off once it reaches 1.25 I might as well get some rest and let some other drivers can get the fare/s.I also don't really chase the surge... by the time you get there, the riders have been picked up, and tons of drivers have arrived. If I know an area is busy, I used to hang in the area, but I don't know now. The number of drivers is up.-----I still have not seen the new cell surge marking the source of a surge. It still shows broad areas like 55th to 27th troost to roe. Or all of downtown.Yes, the surge lasts a long time after riders have been picked up. I sat right smack dab in the middle of power & light when a 2.8 surge started. Not a sole around. Why is there a surge? All it did was bring more drivers to a dead area. If they are elsewhere, where is that?"
Need to rant...,UberXTampa,662521,44433,"Yesterday TIA Cell Phone parking lot was also packed with drivers.I dropped off a pax and decided to wait there. Took almost 30 minutes to get a ride just to the perimeter of the airport which I got to keep $3.xx from after Uber cuts! I was very close to the airport still and I could have gone and tried for another round of insult but I said f- it and moved away towards home.There should be a $10.00 minimum fare for TIA airport pickups. A lot of single digit airport pickups fares are beyond ridiculous, they are insulting.also, if a certain area is over-saturated with drivers, Uber should make it possible to see it in dashboard. If I knew there were 20-30 or even more cars in teh cell phone waiting and short term parking, I would have never waited there. doesn't make sense at all."

But doing it at UberX rates is a JOKE!My car depreciates more per mile than cheaper cars, costs more to maintain, and requires premium gas.

Before they were fully out (2 seconds) the officer yanked the passenger door open and asked if I was uber.I was out of the drive lane on mill street. If I dropped off on mill street itself, I would have blocked traffic where due to people jump starting cars there was only one lane open for both directions.If anything, I was protecting Westport road from drunk drivers that might drive through the barricades.I've seen more blocking with stopped cars in the drive lanes on Broadway, and when a road is closed, officers often are ok with dropping people off in front of the barricades. From Bartle Hall to Westport, plaza, etc.Westport said it was not one of the off duty officers they normally hire.They (Westport merchant association) didn't think it was targeting UBER, as cabs often get tickets for things down there, but were surprised I didn't get asked to leave first if there was an issue.I know that UBER drop offs are fast no payments necessary.

As we see people leave the queue ahead of us, we can determine that is too slow. They could also easily display an average wait time like phone queues.We see 30 cabs in a line at the cab lot. so one would assume its might be busy.These are features that would give the customers a better experience. If drivers are needed, we can tell. If not, we can determine that with a large number in the queue and a long wait time, we could be more useful distributed elsewhere in the city for a quicker response to a user's request.NOTE: I have been called to the airport when at Zona Rosa, so you do not need to be in the queue to get called there. I just puts you in a first come first serve line if you are waiting there.I have only waited twice about half an hour each, but sitting blind, I don't feel like waiting. Not to mention, if I switch to my web browser, the uber app sometimes quits. I don't know if I lost my place.Final question. Are we able to get non-airport calls.

The pin was right outside the airport, but it was incorrect. In fact the pin was off by 3-4 miles, the pax was down in Zona Rosa.

Media request for interview,A S,398999,30846,"HelloI am a reporter for KCUR radio station working on a story about alcohol and drinking and driving in Kansas. I'd like to talk with a driver about picking up people who have been drinking. I know Uber drivers take a lot of people home safely at night, but sometimes these passengers can be obnoxious or dangerous. I think listeners would be interested in hearing about what you see. If you'd like to talk or know a driver who would, please let me know.My phone: 816-235-6423Thanks, Alex"

User question for KC - Any way around the airport pickup limit?,Casem,217039,15987,"The only workaround is to physically drag your gps pin outside of the geo-fenced airport grounds and then request an UberX. Once a driver grabs your request, you would need to call them immediately and tell them where you are.This works in theory. Two problems in practical application:1. Drivers may be leery of this, as you could theoretically be an airport cop or something.2. There isn't much by way of volume in the north suburbs yet. Therefore, it may be difficult to connect with a driver (even outside of airport grounds) unless you catch someone who just so happens to be leaving MCI.Failing that, just message me and we can exchange contact info.

The truth about what happened in Topeka,newsboy559,230856,16863,"The mass email from Uber yesterday is the most deceptive thing yet that I've seen from this company. Here is the absolute 100% truth about what happened regarding SB117 in the Kansas Legislature.Lawmakers were not even considering any legislation whatsoever regarding TNC's during this session. I am more in the know about the legislature than most, so I began to wonder why nothing was happening. So much so, that I almost picked up the phone and called my area legislator to find out if anything was happening. Now I know that there was nothing happening regarding TNC's until 3/25.If you look at SB117, the original bill, it has nothing to do with Uber or TNC's whatsoever. It is concerning insurance; relating to self-insurance under the health care provider insurance availability act; health care systems. Now take a look at the amendment. The amendment regarding TNC's was snuck in at the last moment in hopes that nobody would notice. Again, it has absolutely nothing to do with the original bill regarding health insurance.Uber wrote this TNC bill (the amendment to SB117) completely on their own. UBER brought all of this to the Table. They are the ones who created the bill and then asked it to be put into law.UBER's original bill that they brought to the table was written to protect themselves from having to pay out big insurance claims to the insurance companies if something happened.The lawmakers and insurance companies caught wind of this and, of course, they weren't going to allow UBER to just write their own bill, so the insurance companies began lobbying for it on the floor and to the committee discussing it.The Insurance companies and lobbyists then switched the tables on UBER at the last minute and added section #4 that discusses insurance requirements for drivers of vehicles with liens, requiring full coverage insurance at all times when the app is on, rider or no rider. This protects the banks and the insurance companies who still have liens on vehicles that aren't paid off.UBER is now trying to kill the bill that they were the original creators of because now it actually has turned against them.Kansas had no regulations on this and it wasn't even considering it this session until UBER themselves made it a point to try to undercut all of us and be shady as shit...hoping that their version of the bill would get passed without anybody noticing.Now that it didn't happen, they know that if it passes, they just screwed themselves... and us along with them.And that is the absolute truth!"

Uber's Regulatory Duplicity in Kansas,newsboy559,230922,16554,"Right. You need to click the second amendment to see the added paragraph that the banking and insurance lobbyists got put into the bill. This paragraph specifically requires Uber's insurance to cover the driver at all times, from the moment he turns on the app until the moment he turns it off. As it is now, the DRIVER's insurance is primary while the driver does not have a paying passenger in the vehicle. Uber's insurance only kicks in when the driver begins a fare and has a paying passenger inside the vehicle.Furthermore, the second amendment would require Uber to fully insure the driver at all times. Why would drivers be against this? It removes the question or possibility of having their personal insurance company dropping them for fraud and being accused of working commercially on a personal policy. Uber does not want to protect its drivers fully because it would cost too much. And these are the same drivers that Uber will convince to go protest at the statehouse against the legislation that Uber itself attempted to write and quietly get passed as an attachment to an unrelated bill regarding health insurance.Sickening..."

This company somehow convinces its driver ""partners,' who are in no way 'partners' with this company, to show up in droves to back it up when government agencies threaten the dreaded regulation. The fact of the matter is, this whole TNC thing desperately needs SOME sort of oversight and regulation in order to protect the very drivers that this company (and others) so rampantly take advantage of.I mean, in cases of small fares or minimum fares, this company takes as much as 40% of the fare!

Or is it a daily drive to the Plaza/midtown/downtown to get real work? How busy does Uber keep you?The rates look meager. I have a nice minivan but don't know how much that will help (xl fares?). If I needed full time money, I likely would have already bailed on the idea, but just looking for some part time money that keeps me out of retail and food service. I've had a commercial driver's license for the last 10 years so that knocks $100 or so off the cost of getting legal.

KC metro demand,ace864,180713,13096,Same here. I just started to process myself and I have been wanting to same info. It doesn't look good right now however that there haven't been any responses to your post yet.Have you got any farther in your process Casher?
KC metro demand,Prentiss,182326,168314,"HelloIll try to answer a few of your questions. We have a very lazy marketing manager that thinks people are going to promote the company ay 5 dollars a referral. He doesn't market to the out lying areas and nobody sets in these areas because nobody their knows about us or cant get a driver when the need one.After the dramatic price decrease I have gotten more ride requests but is it really worth 2.40 cents to go from downtown to almost midtown ? I myself have returned back to work and only do the maybe 1 day a week now so ill tell you what I know from driving since June. I used to keep quiet because it took me a long time to figure it out.I always got out at 4:45 am M-F and sat on the plaza waiting for airport runs""At one time they paid off because the distance but now its just dead miles back at a lower rate"" Because nobody is out at this time of morning and demand is high around 5:30. Sometimes I could come back and get another. and a lot of smaller trips after 7:00.And its obvious you want to take advantage of the guarantee on Friday and Saturday night. But also their is a hidden gem of what I call ""Walk of shamers"" or people enjoying life! That usaly starts about 7am on Saturday & Sunday mornings at last about all morning taking people back to their cars after a long night. And usualy their isen't a lot of drivers out at that time.Hope this helps and remember not to put all your eggs in one basket when driving for uber because the change things and rates overnight all the time."

Draft ordinance to Be presented to City Thursday Feb 5,Casher,171065,13136,The ordinance draft was presented but they zeroed in pretty quickly on a side issue that only affects taxis.Ordinance doesn't appear to have changed much. 50 bucks knocked off vehicle permit fee (from 300 to 250). Says drivers can get their permit in one visit instead of coming back for an interview. They went over the insurance part really quickly. Nothing stood out that seemed to help...but will have to review that wording after the meeting.

Draft ordinance to Be presented to City Thursday Feb 5,John_in_kc,171197,13136,looks like insurance is a biggie in the law change too. period 1 must be 100/300/100 instead of 50/100. must do claims local and must be admitted carrier. I think Uber can do it but they won't like to.

Still waiting on the photos of my car to be approved, but I'm beginning to get worried because of these stuff with the city. I was hoping to do Uber part time as a way to get extra income but I don't want to have to put a ton of money into this in order to drive. Its suppose to be extra income, not something to dump more money into.Realistically do you guys think it'll work out or is it something that isn't going to work well for part timers like myself?"

Permit question,Jeanna294,67323,5656,Has anybody tried obtaining a class E driver' license in order to try avoiding a ticket? If so did it prevent the ticket? Any responses pertaining to this issue would be appreciated.
Permit question,John_in_kc,69519,5656,"Last I heard is Uber is getting a permitting scheme set up with the city. Don't know when it will be ready. I understood all tickets are on hold pending outcomes. but that is all third hand.So basically to sum up my post, I don't know anymore than you."
Permit question,MciDave,93447,5656,"Having a Class E License will not prevent you from getting a ticket, if a cop is going to write you they are going to write you PERIOD! See my thread Areas to watchIn regards to the permitting issue, according to Regulated Industries, you need a permit, I address this in my thread KC Requires UBER Drivers to have Valid Livery Permit, your looking at $445.00 total to be legal. I heard from a birdie in Regulated Industries after January 1, 2015 if your caught driving for Uber without a permit, you will be ticketed and it will not be put on hold"

Kansas City Tips and Tricks,,4368,0,
Kansas City Tips and Tricks,John_in_kc,47138,4368,thought I would start a thread for local tips and tricks.For me:I have a clean car club membership with Waterway. I get my car washed 2x per week. Once on Wednesday with free upgraded wheel deal that does the inside and out plus .10 off per gallon instead of the std .05 off.I like running the app from home after work and kids are in bed. I usually get a couple $30 plus fares a week which covers gas over the weekend typically.With the cooler weather I like to park more with car off near plaza on weekend. Gets a few more rides plus saves gas.
Kansas City Tips and Tricks,John_in_kc,48910,4368,"I do keep iced water with me. I have a little cooler on passenger floorboard with 6 bottles in it and a bigger 12 bottle cooler in trunk chilling with a spare dry case. I also carry Kleenex, Advil, gum, tums, and wet wipes.Not sure if I should have other drink options. If I did it during the day maybe iced coffee or something like that."
Kansas City Tips and Tricks,MciDave,72908,4368,"John does having the water, Advil, tums and wet wipes really pay off for the added expense you have put out? I have napkins and tissues, but have found the majority of my KC riders are just looking to get from point ""A"" to point ""B"". I was presented with the first phone charger request on Halloween, iPhone 5, of which I do not have a cord for. I'm considering getting a multi charger but have not found exactly what I'm looking for.As for my vehicle, I clean the interior daily, vacuum, clean the windows, Febreeze the seats and wash it - a clean car not only looks good it ensures higher ratings. I have found a self serve car wash on Independence Avenue and Van Brunt that has just wash and rinse that only costs me a whole dollar a day to wash my car. You receive (2) 50 cent tokens for a dollar and there is enough time for me to wash my car since it's not that dirty to begin with, I dry all my windows so there's no streaks, towel dry the rest of the car and shine the tires each time. A 15 minute investment that provides me a nice clean car and 5 star ratings."
Kansas City Tips and Tricks,John_in_kc,73525,4368,"Yes. Water is cheap at walmart it is appreciated if not used. $3 case of water lasts a couple weeks. I get an 18 pack orbit and Costco. lasts forever. It is not that they are constantly consumed, it is that they are available and I have prepared and planned to provide a quality experience.I am a 4.92-3 star."
Kansas City Tips and Tricks,Prentiss,75124,4368,I buy a big bag of the white chalky wrapped mints from walmart. Last about 2 months for 6 bucks. No water.

Areas to Watch Out,,7929,0,
Areas to Watch Out,MciDave,93440,7929,"I think KC local drivers need to be aware of areas to watch out for while your on your way to or carrying ridersI think the top of the list is the entire little city of Mission Hills, Kansas. Every street is 25 mph, be especially careful on 63rd street West Bound through Mission Hills, there is usually a cop (Daly) sitting at the bottom of the hill in the 2900 block, that will write you a ticket for any speed that pops into her head, also watch stopping too long at the stop sign at the bottom of the hill, Officer Daly views that as a sign of being intoxicated, she will also try to escalate the traffic stop in an effort to make an arrest."
Areas to Watch Out,John_in_kc,95665,7929,Gotta make up for lack of sales tax revenue. I mean it is the plaza toll road...
Areas to Watch Out,MciDave,111094,7929,"Okay here I go again, for the second time in less then a month I managed to get a ticket in Mission Hills Kansas tonight. Just after dropping my riders in the 2100 block of Tomahawk Road, I was writing down my trip information on my log and I had a cop pull up behind me and turn on his lights. He claimed I ran a stop light at 63rd and State Line Road and intersection I stopped at waited for the green light and drove through just 31/2 minutes prior to reaching my destination. When I stopped at that intersection I didn't see any cars on any of the side streets, in front of me or behind me. Unless this cop was sitting on the Missouri side on a side street there was no way he could have seen me commit this alleged violation, he claims to have it on camera, yeah I wonder if it's like the cop that claimed she had me speeding on camera too and there's nothing. So basically what I'm saying stay the hell out of Mission Hills Kansas unless you have a lot of money to spend on lawyers fees and court costs and fines"
Areas to Watch Out,John_in_kc,111197,7929,Officer friendly is going for a Christmas bonus.
Areas to Watch Out,MciDave,111286,7929,"Obviously, Mission Hills issues more tickets then Overland Park does I'm guessing. I'm about to find that out"
Areas to Watch Out,John_in_kc,111290,7929,"I have only been stopped once ubering. It was on the plaza. Said I ""rolled"" an intersection. No ticket, verbal warning, no mention of Uber.Overland Park is just glad when 5 pm hits and everyone goes home. I have lived there all my life. The police are very nice in Overland Park.Mission Hills likes to maintain a certain decorum. they don't like a lot of traffic coming in and out. They are concerned about burglary there, and rightfully so. If the car doesn't look like it belongs, it gets flagged down.Their police are actually prairie village police (but drive a car dressed up as mission hills). I wonder if they get paid per ticket on the contract with PV?"

Is Uber an ilegal taxi cab service?,MciDave,72895,5480,"I know I'm a tad late in joinng this string, but I have been busy driving along with researching out Chapter 76 of the City Code regarding the issue of licensing and such since I have fell victim to being ticketed for simply going to P&L to pick up an intoxicated friend of mine while not driving for Uber. As I play the city's game they have decided to play this week on just how they want to license or permit Uber drivers, I have found that the majority of violations were issued by two rogue police officers one Sargent Simons and an unnamed police office (at the present time) either in P&L or Westport. I have also found that pursuant to section 76 of the city code ONLY the Director of Regulated Industries has the authority to enforce taxicab, cab or livery violations.Although Uber is providing an attorney to represent me on the two charges I received, the mere fact that Kansas City has two rogue police officers taking the law into their own hands such as they have subjects them to civil actions for abuse of authority. I encourage any Uber driver that received a violation of section 76-231 of the City Code to file a complaint with Office of Community Complaints 635 Woodland, Kansas City, Missouri. This will be investigated by Internal Affairs of the Police Department. Until such time as Regulated Industries makes a final decision on just how they want to license/permit Uber drivers police falsely charging drivers with violations is harassment and a violation of your 16th amendment right to Fair and Equal Treatment under the law.I'm seeking out those other drivers that have received citations from Sgt. Simons and the other officer for a class action suit following the conclusion of the court hearings on the taxicab violations."

Fare cut,,5212,0,
Fare cut,Bee,60034,5212,"Uber has announced basically a 40% rate cut today. I'm not thrilled about this. They've guaranteed $20 an hour this weekend for peak times. This is about a week or two after the $10 phone fee. I don't want to drive twice as much for the same money. It is not worth wearing out my car and risking getting sued for a few bucks an hour.I don't understand why Uber feels the need to compete on both price and quality. It is a premium service. You're being picked up in a nice car in minutes, by a person who hopefully doesn't smell like a bag of sweat socks and speaks English.I'm about to turn in my phone."
Fare cut,John_in_kc,63001,5212,"Things go on sale to promote traffic. lower the entry point equals more users.I am glad they are doing the per hr min to transition.I don't know about driving 2x as much for same money, but instead of waiting 30 min for a ride, if they are coming in every 5 to 10 minutes, that means more rides per hour, not really a whole lot more miles.The equation of risk vs reward does not change, it may become more obvious but it has always been there.not shilling for Uber here but $20 an hour is about right for what we do.
